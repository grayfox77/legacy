<H1>Konami Cartridges Combination List</H1>
I've looked at the code of all konami games in search of combinations. 
I hope this is the complete list.
<P>
To use these combinations, put the game you wish to play in slot A and 
the other in slot B. If it does not have the effect stated here your 
ROM file could be damaged, or there may be a mistake in this list. 
Please 
<A HREF="mailto:sean@msxnet.org">mail</A> 
me any corrections, questions, whatever.
<P>
Note that mostly only one combination is possible at a time, e.g.: Usas 
'combines' with four different cartridges, but you can't put all of them 
in a slot expander or something: Usas stops searching after it's found one of
the four.
<P>
I haven't listed the standard Game Master (2) combinations, only some special 
Game Master combinations.

     You can save the game to tape by pressing &lt;F4&gt; and load it by pressing &lt;F5&gt;. 
     You must have Hinotori in a lower slot for this combination.
