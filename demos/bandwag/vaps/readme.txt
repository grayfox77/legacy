 BANDWAGON: ELŽK™™N VAPAUS
 =========================
  Came 3rd on the Plutonium'98 demo
  competition held in Loviisa, Finland
  3.-5.7.98.

 Required and recommended:
 - MSX1/VDP1/PSG/DOS1/64k

 Usage:
 - type VAPAUS at the command prompt

 Yeah, another travesty as a result
 of working like hell for too short
 a period. I still like it and some
 other people admit doing so too,
 I doubt if the MSX2-puritanists
 will. I would appreciate if you
 dropped me a letter with some
 comments, but that's seldom happened
 before although I have asked.

 This is actually the bugfixed version
 I wrote once I learned that the demo
 hung up on the screen change in part 2
 on some machines. I was before using a
 BIOS-call and now I change the screen
 myself, I hope that won't arise new
 problems with other MSX-brands.

 By the way, please try to view this
 with a TV or a videoscreen, that's
 the way it was intended to. A monitor
 gives just too much focus and spoils
 most of the effects.

 And in case you didn't notice, press
 and hold space to exit the last part.
 You can also utterly spoil the music
 sync and skip fx in normal parts too
 with the space bar.

 Featuring:
 - multicolour plasma in a 32x64 window
   in Screen 2.
 - a 64x64-bumpmap in Screen 2.
 - a repetive screenwobbler in Screen 1
 - some interference patterns in
   Screen 1, some of them in
   fake-Screen 2 (SCR2 modebit turned
   on).
 - striped and texturemapped cones
   in Screen 1.
 - 256x192 graphics.
 - sampled sequences in 8 Khz.
 - bleepy PSG-music in glorius
   three tones+one noise.
 - the usual amount of bad, flashy
   music syncs.
