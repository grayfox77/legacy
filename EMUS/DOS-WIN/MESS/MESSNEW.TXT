System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- PC: Mouse now very usable, PC CGA scrolling support in 320x200x2 fixed 
  (Boulderdash), Tandy1000 Graphics memory switching enchanced (Lemmings), 
  Joystick changes (slow autocenter remaining), added xtcga with mf2 keyboard 
  and turbo switch, split the xtvga in xtega (vga with ega monitor), and added 
  palette handling to ega/vga. [Peter Trauner]

- C364: preliminary speech added (similar hardware in the C64 
  cartridge Magic Voice, used in few programs). [Peter Trauner]

- C128: Esc-x to switch c128 to 40 column mode. Keypad enter to switch 
  emulator to 40 column mode. In the input keys configuration menu you 
  should find several key assignments with normal (not reversed)T.  Change 
  these to another key, and the normal T will work. (in the system file 
  these keys are disabled, until I find a better solution) [Peter Trauner]

- MACPLUS: driver boots (must use the 68k C core) [Nate Woods]

- SEGA MASTER SYSTEM: Rewrite of the SMS video code, so quite a lot of games with
  interrupt problems or corrupt graphics run fine now. [Charles MacDonald]

- SPECTRUM: Added support for 128K .SNA and .Z80 files, ensured that the 48K Basic 
  ROM is paged in when running 48K snapshots on 128K machine (for improved 
  reliability and access to the default character set), changed +3 initialisation, 
  128 and +3 now set 0x4000-0x7fff to bank 5 (Now not changed if switching to shadow 
  screen), cleaned up spectrum_plus3_update_memory, fixed bug in decoding uncompressed 
  v2+ .Z80 files, and changed running speed of 128K Machines to 3.54690MHz
  [David Robertson]

- COMMODORE: cbmdrive (memory freeing) fixed, cia6526 tod fix, c128fra fix, 
  50 hertz machines now really have 50 hz video refresh, c16 1551 simulation fixed 
  [Peter Trauner]

- DRAGON series: Now supports a new variant of the .PAK file format for snapshots.
  [Nate Woods]

- TI99:  Mini Memory Support (rename minimemc.bin to minimemm.bin for it to 
  work correctly), fixed a bug in banked roms when a hard reset (F3) is done, rom 
  images are now identified by their filename extensions (image order isn't important 
  anymore), no need to use NUL when no grom image, both alt -> fctn and both ctrl -> ctrl 
  added, and new rom image extensions (.c .d .m .g .crom. drom. mrom .grom).
  [Norberto Alfredo Bensa]

- A7800: Support for bankswitched carts and carts with extra RAM, added 160B video mode, 
  increased screen height to fix clipping at bottom, updated header format (details can be 
  found in machine/a7800.c), added support for light gun trigger (not the light gun 
  targetting yet, just the trigger), and removed requirment for a cartridge (since the 7800 
  starts in the BIOS it doesn't technically need a cartridge) [Dan Boris]




Other Changes:
--------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.37b2. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- TOOLS: Disk Utility added (mkhdimg.exe) which will create variable sized HD images 
  for use in MESS.  Can create images from 9,216 bytes to 142,606,848 bytes 
  without problems.  The Western Digital 1004A that is emulated in MESS is 
  limited to 1024 Cylinders and 16 heads. The sector size is limited to 512 
  bytes as well as the sectors per track being limited to 17, this is also 
  due to the WD1004A's limitations. [Randy Rains]

- TOOLS: Generic image tool added (imgtool.exe) with the following features:
  *MAME/MESS style driver architecture; where the image formats are contained in drivers.  
   Currently, the only driver is for CoCo .DSK disk images, but there could be more.
  *Runs on the command line.
  *Commands for listing image contents, retrieving and storing files.
  *Supports images in .ZIP files.
  *"Engine" is separate from the "shell"; which gives the potential for front ends for 
   those who don't like command lines. [Nate Woods]

- Disk write support for AMSTRAD CPC [Oscar Martín González]

- Wave timer fix [Oscar Martín González]

- m6510t/m7501/m8502 CPU cores added [Peter Trauner]

- Extensive CRC updates.
