v0.3  981018
------------
* Fixed a stupid "bug" that caused the PSG to update only at 25Hz
  instead of 50Hz.
* .CAS files can be any size (<512k) instead of a multiple of 4096.
* Added VDP support for magnified sprites [Graphic Chess, Pengwyn]
* Wind/rewind tape with F6/F7
* Configuration file (svi.cfg) added:
    - Default paths & configurations
    - Possibility to create your own configurations
* Tape autorun (except on files saved with "save")
* Screen 2 roughly added (only supports the default char- & nametable)

v0.2  981013 (not released to public)
------------
* Basic Z80 emulation in 100% asm (very few undoc. opcodes working)
* Almost perfect VDP emulation: screen 2 and enlarged sprites missing.
* Basic PSG emulation; high frequency sound sounds awful.
  Only supports SB cards that can be autodetected. Emulator may
  crash if the SB card is used by another application.
* Emulates both SVI 318 and SVI 328
* Full RAM 16k cart and RAM 64k cart support.
* Save RAM image to file (QUICK.IMG)
* Basic tape simulation using patching of ROM. Fast & ugly.
  Rotten tape support - no possibility to wind/rewind or change tape
  during emulation.
* Joystick emulation
* Speedsync. with real SVI (100%, 200%, 400%)
* Changable palette
