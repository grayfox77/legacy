About GEM
---------
GEM is a Gameboy emulator for MSX2/turboR running MSX-DOS2 written in 100%
assembly language. Since version v0.9990, Gfx9000 is required as well. By 
employing advanced translation techniques, GEM is able to run games at
playable speeds.


System Configuration
--------------------
Minimum:
MSX2, 256kB RAM, MSX-DOS2, Gfx9000
or
MSXturboR, Gfx9000

Recommended:
MSXturboR, Gfx9000, SCC, 4MB Memory Mapper

Memory requirements:
GEM requires 144kB to run at all. Additionally, it needs space to store the
Gameboy ROM, which may be in an external Memory Mapper. To be able to use
the Dynamic Recompiler, space for twice the ROM size is required and at
least 16K in main memory for cached translations.


Usage
-----
Just type GEM [FILENAME.EXT], you can specify any directorypath with both
GEM and the ROM in question.


Controls
--------
Gameboy: MSX:
Joypad - Cursors
A      - Shift
B      - Ctrl
Start  - Return
Select - Select

ESC enters GEM's so-called configuration mode. This is indicated by the
CAPS LED which will light up.

Configuration mode controls are:
ESC  - Exits GEM
STOP - Exits configuration mode without changes
BS   - Backspace resets the emulated Gameboy
0    - Display all frames
1    - Display 1/2 of all frames
2    - Display 1/3 of all frames
3    - Display 1/4 of all frames
4    - Display 1/5 of all frames
5    - Display 1/6 of all frames
6    - Display 1/7 of all frames
7    - Display 1/8 of all frames


What's New
----------
19 August 2010, v1.01

  - Fixed grave bug in block chaining.

12 August 2010, v1.0

TNI celebrates GEM's 10th anniversary! Among other great improvements, this
release brings a massive speed increase. With a small amount of frameskip,
most games play fast enough to be enjoyed and many even run at full speed!

  - Greatly improved sound emulation.
    * Emulated sound lengths.
    * Conversion of GB linear to PSG logarithmic volumes.
    * Noise channel emulation on PSG.
    * Added proper SCC emulation of the GB wave channel.
    * Removed problematic PSG emulation of the GB wave channel.
    * SCC support with accurate emulation of waveforms.
    * Emulated volume envelopes.
    * Partially emulated pitch sweep register.
  - Greatly improved Dynamic Recompiler.
    * Cache purging.
    * Block chaining.
    * Lazy evaluation of CPU registers.
    * Optimized block loops.
    * Static CPU simulation for improved code quality.
    * Optimized block epilogue.
    * Extended blocks beyond conditional jumps.
    * Memory segment tracking.
    * Optimized cache handling.
    * Optimized memory access.
    * Optimized I/O access.
  - Greatly improved memory management.
    * External Memory Mapper support. Large games finally work on MSX turboR!
    * Rewrote loading and startup.
    * Proper DOS2 memory handling, GEM now works in all DOS2 environments.
  - Removed F5 key sound switch from configuration mode.
  - Optimized GB Sprite DMA.

8 August 2007, v0.9990

  This release signifies a major step. After the failing of the LPE-Z380
  in the MSX scene, GEMZ was discontinued and I've decided to return to
  GEM. The new goal for GEM is to emulate the Gameboy fast and accurate
  enough to play the classic Gameboy games enjoyably and work towards
  Gameboy Color emulation.

  New in this version:

  - The v0.8 source code was lost, but was rebuilt by comparing the v0.8
    binary with the v0.7 source code.
  - A major reorganisation and clean-up of the entire source code. The
    source code is now much more flexible, maintainable and better fit to
    accept new features.
  - Implemented a more flexible graphics conversion method.
  - Got rid of all V99x8 renderers, GEM now requires Gfx9000.
  - Full smooth scrolling in the V9990 renderer.
  - Sped up GB interrupt handling.
  - Fixed a recompiler bug that sometimes corrupted the GB AF register.
  - More accurate CPU flag emulation, fixes some games.
    * Implemented correct GB CPU flag register layout.
    * Fixed or improved flag behaviour in various instructions.
  - Fixed a bug in the config file parser. (Patch for v0.8 available)
  - R800 LED enabled.
  - Various small changes during the course of the reorganisation.

v0.1 (12 March 2000) - v0.8 (24 September 2003)
