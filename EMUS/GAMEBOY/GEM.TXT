About GEM
---------
GEM is a Gameboy emulator for MSX2/turboR running MSX-DOS2 written in 100%
assembly language. As of version v1.0, Gfx9000 is required as well.


System Configuration
--------------------
Minimum:
MSX2, 256kB RAM, MSX-DOS2, Gfx9000
or
MSX turboR, Gfx9000

GEM is optimized for R800, so running it on a MSX turboR gives the best
performance.

Free memory required:
160kB + ROM-size (absolute minimum, uses Interpreter mode only)
160kB + 2 * ROM-size + ... (Dynamic Recompiler mode)

The Dynamic Recompiler needs memory for its code-cache. The amount needed
differs per ROM. If memory runs out, the remainder of the ROM program will
be interpreted which has a negative effect on speed.

GEM doesn't do any mapper switching and works from the mapper DOS selected.


Usage
-----
Just type GEM [FILENAME.EXT], you can specify any directorypath with both
GEM and the ROM in question.

What's New
----------
8 August 2007, v0.9990

  This release signifies a major step. After the failing of the LPE-Z380
  in the MSX scene, GEMZ was discontinued and I've decided to return to
  GEM. The new goal for GEM is to emulate the Gameboy fast and accurate
  enough to play the classic Gameboy games enjoyably and work towards
  Gameboy Color emulation.

  New in this version:

  - The v0.8 source code was lost, but was rebuilt by comparing the v0.8
    binary with the v0.7 source code.
  - A major reorganisation and clean-up of the entire source code. The
    source code is now much more flexible, maintainable and better fit to
    accept new features.
  - Implemented a more flexible graphics conversion method.
  - Got rid of all V99x8 renderers, GEM now requires Gfx9000.
  - Full smooth scrolling in the V9990 renderer.
  - Sped up GB interrupt handling.
  - Fixed a recompiler bug that sometimes corrupted the GB AF register.
  - More accurate CPU flag emulation, fixes some games.
    * Implemented correct GB CPU flag register layout.
    * Fixed or improved flag behaviour in various instructions.
  - Fixed a bug in the config file parser. (Patch for v0.8 available)
  - R800 LED enabled.
  - Various small changes during the course of the reorganisation.

v0.1 (12 March 2000) - v0.8 (24 September 2003)
