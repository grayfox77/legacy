Hi Folks!                                          June 6th, 1994
                                                EL Belloto, CHILE

             
             I present to you, a nice ZX-Spectrum 48 Emulator  made
 by CHM&JHM productions.  It  took them a  lot of time  of  intense
 coding and sleepless hours .
 
 Why a emulator??, oh really I don't Know it, but CHM&JHM worked on
 SPECTRUM lot of years ago. so probably they loved it. 
  
             Well, It isn't quite really an emulator, because It only
 simulates a ZX-Spectrum's BIOS.  So, you can only execute the programs 
 that uses the BIOS's Routines (To read keyboard, change colours, 
 tape load, and so on.). 
 
 
            The requeriments:
 
            
 - At least a MSX2 computer with 128Kb Memory mapper. Although It also
   runs into a MSX1 (with Memory Mapper). MSX2 is needed, because the
   program changes the colour palette to simulate the ZX's colours.
   Therefore... no MSX2 (or higher) ==> no real colours :(
   
 - A diskdrive is needed, although if You don't have one, Don't worry,
   because there is a solution:   You must type "poke 62273,N", 
   and "N" is the Slot's adress where your computer has the Ram (Memory 
   Mapper), a bit manual, no?
   
   
        On the Spectrum, The keyboard distribution is a bit different
   than ours MSXs, so you need a "Keyboard Map" to work perfectly with
   the spectrum. Here goes:

LfArr = Left Arrow
RtArr = Right "
UpArr = Up    "
DnArr = Down  "
Symbol Shift on MSX is Shift
Caps Shift on MSX is Caps

If You already known the Spectrum's keyboard, You will can easyly, access 
all the functions. However, if you didn't know the Spectrum, You should
find somebody who can learn to you.



   The emulator has two features.
   
   
   1.-    You can work simultaneously with both, MSX and Spectrum,
      but like all the CHM&JHM's software, you must to do it manually.
   
   In Spectrum mode, type:
   
                RANDOMIZE USR 15406 to activate the MSX mode.
             
   in MSX mode, type:
   
                Run 440               ;to activate the Spectrum mode.
                                         
   2.- You can load and save to/from tape equal than a Spectrum.
