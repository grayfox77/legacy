[05 Jun 2000]
Released on the internet @ http://www.vanheusden.com/

Version 0.011beta [...]
<haven't done anything on that version yet>

Version 0.010beta [06 5 94]
- Some bit-shift routines optimised
- Block Move/Compare routines optimised
- Memory Read/Write routines optimised and bug fixed
- Hardware (other then Z80) emulation optimised
- z80-emulation bug removed
- Removed bug in SCC(+) emulation
+ FM-Pac emulation: the sound was already there; in this version the 8Kb of
  game-data is emulated too
* Tryed to emulate a diskdrive by catching the MSX-Bios calls 0x4010 (etc.),
  doesn't work: after the beep, the thing resets (the emulated MSX, not the
  emulator)
- Removed some dead code
- removed bug: it shouldm't screw up the ST's I/O-things like the diskdrive
  and the parallel port
> This is a special Turfschip-computerbeurs release! :-)

Version 0.009beta [24 april 1994]
+ Added SCC+ emulation
- Removed some dead code
- Did some optimising

Version 0.008beta [23 april 1994]
- when attempting to read or write from an _defined_ but disabled I/O-port,
  the emulator wouldn't abort. fixed, the emulator will abort now (that is:
  it will ask you if you want to exit)
- bug removed in memory-setup menu. when using a memory-mapper, to the total
  number of pages was added 4 extra
- cleaned source a bit up
- some little optimizing
- very little bug removed: most of unofficial instructions wouldn't cause a
  the "unknown instruction"-exit when disabled, fixed
+ added initial functions for VDP-commands
+ added posibility for using extended VRAM (extra 64Kb)
+ VDP 'pset'-command added
+ VDP 'line'-command added
+ extra VDP-error messages added
+ added mouse & light-pen support (light-pen emulation using mouse) via MSX-2
  VDP. Not very usefull because I heard this week that not much software uses
  that way of mouse-stuff (including the OS :-[ )
* started working on VDP 'srch'-command
- removed bug causing problems when using SCC-chip or other hardware which
  needs to be configured using int's.
+ you can now use out 0,0 (or the assembler-command) to enter a menu with
  some special functions. The port-numer is configurable in the set-up
+ added totally useless CPU-Usage indicator
+ depending jumps & calls optimized
+ Re-coded memory-mapper emulation. You can use now up to 16 memorymappers!
  Fully user-configurable of course. 16 memory mappers means that you can have
  a maximum of 64Mb memory
* Started working on FM-Pac emulation. Many thanks to Roderik Muit for giving
  me very clear and usefull documents about that little piece (peace :-]) of
  hardware.
* Started working on high-level diskdrive emulation
+ Last minute update: added printer re-direction [to file]

Version 0.005beta [9 april 1994]
- bug removed in secundairy slot select
* added support for screen 4 to 8 [msx 2]
- bugs removed in data-recorder re-direction [to diskdrive]
- removed some very little sneaky bug in the inc/dec/add/sub routines
* first attempt on 'DAA'-debugging, works for 50% now :-/
b.t.w. This version was brought out in some kind of disk-magazine. I'm not sure
if this version already showed its version-number.

Version 0.003beta [about april the 5th 1994]
First release. Probably lots of bugs although I can't find them.
