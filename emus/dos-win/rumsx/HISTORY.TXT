RuMSX history:
--------------

Version 0.25:
- MSX-Printer emulation improved (subscript+superscript added,
  graphics printing in Dynamic-Publisher works now too)
- "Harry Fox Yki" renamed to "Harry Fox with Snow Demonking"
  to avoid confusion between different versions of the game.
- System-Info property-page: increased size of processor info
  because some translations have been truncated
- Removed Windows Help from menu
- Changed helpfile from *.HLP to *.CHM format
  (requires Internet-Explorer 4 or HHUPD.EXE to be installed)
  and provided new MSDN-like help with Full-Text-Search index.
- Fixed MSX Turbo-R configurations for improved compatibility
  + Moved MSXTRMUS.ROM into Slot 0-2
  + Added MSXTROPT.ROM into Slot 0-3
  Slot 0 is now expanded and TR-logo is displayed
- Added new RuMSX-icons
- Configuration-editor corrupted RuMSX configurations
  if a memory-block exceeded 4 pages (i.e. as MSX1 RAM)
- Added "Hangul" key-support in addition to "Kana"
  (requires presence of native MSX language information
  in RuMSX configuration files)
- DISK.ROM can now be inserted into any available slot
  if the MSX configuration does not provide disk-support
  (previous versions did not patch the BIOS entries)
- Added support for concatenated disk-images
- Locale-Dialog could failed to restore default keyboard-layout
  (if changed), a valid driver-file have had to be selected.

Version 0.24:
- Selected joystick was not remembered if DirectX drivers only
  were present on the system (i.e. if using Windows 2000)
- Minor changes in SOFTWARE.HLP and MSX.HLP
- Added fMSX compatible ROM-Type 6 for Konami Game-Master 2
  (previous value 127 is still supported and should be used
  within RuMSX, new value is supported for compatibility only)
- GameMaster 2 Mapper changed (SRAM fixed)
- Multiple SlotExpanders caused conflicts and
  unpredictable results
- ROM-Type detection enhanced: PAINTER.ROM, LOTLOT.ROM and
  MSXAUDIO.ROM, RTYPE.ROM and HALNOTE.ROM are now handled
  even better (and more compatible)
- Apply button was not always enabled after device-properties
  have been changed: available mouse-devices, Disk, Keyboard
  and Video properties could be changed without apply enabled.
- Color-Palette was not correct if MSX1 configuration used
- New ROM-Type for "Harry Fox Yki" added (now working)
- Loadable keyboard-driver added
- Fixed VDP-Statusregister mismatch
  (Penguin Kun Wars 2 is working now)
- Added a Device/Setup button to set-up selected DirectInput
  devices (most likely used to calibrate joysticks)
- Added option to disable screensaver while RuMSX
  is running (for presentations and demonstrations)
- Fixed Mouse-support (button-clicks are now also recognized,
  even if mouse-movement is not queried).
- Fixed SETUP.EXE for long pathnames containing spaces
- Added MSX-Printer emulation (BETA, for evaluation)
  Windows-Printer works now like a MSX-Printer,
  Evaluation version recommends 300dpi printer (laser or ink)

Version 0.23:
- Activation of different Desktop-Themes or the
  "high-contrast" option could result in a strange
  layout and required RuMSX to be restarted.
- Last-error field in Video-tab of the "Devices"
  property-sheet did not have a word-break (single line)
- Locale-option "Windows keyboard" is now disabled,
  because still not implemented yet!
- KEYBOARD.ZIP updated with old keyboard-layouts and
  replaced *.KBD files with new ones. Please note that
  the 1digit MSX-locale within the new files is for
  information only.
- In some cases RuMSX V0.22 corrupted savestate-files.
  This occured if saving a new state-file where the state
  was restored from a previous RuMSX-version (i.e. V0.21).
  Message "ERROR: stream VIDEOA(0) has an illegal size!"
- Added QuickSave- and QuickLoad-Option
  (for evaluation only, hotkeys may change)
- RuMSX crashed on Windows NT/2000,
  if closed while running in fullscreen-mode
- Tape forward/rewind-buttons changed
- Propietary configuration files failed to load Kanji-ROM
  (also happened to the outdated file MSXTRold.cfg)
- Updated MSX2P.ROM with 2nd release of ROM
  (Thanks to Jirou Kaneda, ATARULUM@hitel.net)
- Dialog Options/Media enhanced to configure
  behaviour of used tape-images. Tape-support improved.
- Minor corrections in support of new medias (tape, disk)
  which discarded previously choosen files, if canceled
- Minor corrections in localized dialogs to
  improve national language support
- InstallShield remembers directory of previous installation
  (useful if default-directory was changed to another one)

Version 0.22:
- MSX-DOS 2.31 (CALL) FORMAT fixed (CHOICE call was not patched)
  (thanks to Kazuhiro Tsujikawa for patching the ROM once more)
- MSX 2+ configuration enhanced:
  Slot 2 is now extended, Kanji-driver added
- SKR Painter in arabic configuration is working now
  "Arabic MSX2.cfg" and PAINTER.ROM updated
  (thanks to Husni Lutfi for updated arabic ROM)
- logical VDP-operations OR, TOR, XOR, TXOR, NOT, TNOT
  caused incorrect results
  (MSX2 stragegy game "Risk" is working now)
- VDP-Operations using invalid coordinates sometimes
  resulted in incorrect output or crashes
  ("Super Rambo Special" is working now)
- RuMSX failed to use multiple DirectX-devices
  (Joystick, Mouse, ...) at the same time
- Updated SETUP.EXE, which associates changed icons
  since RuMSX V0.21 correctly (no icon for MemoryImage).
  Windows 95 now also can handle saved *.RuM files
  (which is truncated extension of *.RuMSX)
- Updated MSX-WebLinks
  (moved links to the WWW to be more up-to-date)
- Improved MSX-BIOS MainROM documentation
  and added/changed a few other topics
- Windowed mode supports now the commonly used 3D look
- Added one more new RuMSX icon (by Higaki)
- Created new/empty disk-images were too large
  if "Format disk" checkbox was selected (default)
- Formatted disk-sectors were always initialized with $FF
  byte-values, where MSX-Computers do use $40 to init them.
- Changed Kazuhiro Tsujikawa's e-Mail address in AboutBox

Version 0.21:
- Palette warning, Load/Save-state warnings are
  now persistent (saved after terminating RuMSX)
- Cheat-dialog updated (displayed percent-value
  changes according to currently set CPU-speed)
- Reorganized Performance- and Cheat-Dialog
  (coincidence-check and VDP-frequency moved)
- State-information dialog added
- Every(!) failed attempt to restore a saved
  RuMSX memory-state was reported as fatal error
  (typically this is non-fatal, old state unchanged)
- Reboot behaviour changed, if restored memory-image
  is executed in RuMSX (normal state as previously)
- Permanently suspended PSG/SCC played sound
  after closing and restarting RuMSX (temporary)
- Added VDP-debugging capabilities
- improved FM-music emulation (default is still OFF)
  Thanks to hQ for the source-code from his MSXSO-emu!
- Fixed color-palette handling:
  half-finished palette is aborted, if palette-register
  (VDP-register 16) is written.
  "Kyokugen" and "Ys" should work properly now.
- Restoring a saved state in HiRes-mode
  did not restore original colors
- Added support for localized RuMSX versions (plug-ins)
- Add/Edit configuration: VRAM-size combobox was
  right-aligned on some eastern-europe windows versions
  and all versions of Windows 2000
- RuMSX uses now different fullscreen-resolutions
  for different display-resolutions (normal, hires)
- SYSTEM.INI renamed to  MSXSYS.INI  because
  contents appeared to be merged if read on
  Windows NT systems (including Windows 2000)
- LOCALE.INI renamed to MSXLOCAL.INI accordingly
- Added MSX2PMUS.ROM (MSX Music of MSX 2+ computers)

Version 0.20:
- InstallShield-installations added a "RuMSX [Debug]"
  icon with an incorrect filename (link).
- RuMSX.TXT of V0.19 reported an incorrect version
- RuMSX sometimes caused lockup of Windows NT/2000
  shell - or applications. 2nd fix for this problem!
  (Problem was related to the used sound-driver)
- Rapidly toggling between windowed mode and
  fullscreen generated strange display within
  Windows NT
- RuMSX displays now the last used filename if saving
  or loading state-images. This makes use of saved
  states more easily (during hang in a game :-) 
- Saving/loading RuMSX-state always showed a nasty
  warning message. Beta-state is now finished!
  Also: restoring a saved image zeroed the number
  of skipped frames (RuMSX runs slower after that).
- Restoring RuMSX-images destroyed persistent settings
  (CMOS-ROM, SRAM, ...)
- Accessing real floppy-disks might cause corruption
  of copy-protected MSX-software. Warning added!
- Added help for usage of "Metal Gear" saved games
- RuMSX crashed if booted using "SexBunny" disk/image
  (high-frequently toggling between 192 and 212 lines)
- Fixing of VDP-emulation
  (i.e. "Emerald Dragon" and "Painter" are working now)
- Heavy performance-problems with Turbo-R software
  can be worked around by using the new "Cheat"-option
- Result of RuMSX restore did not display an icon
  (so error, warning, info was not directly visible)
- Minor enhancements to MSX-Basic help
  (improved details/index for Joystick/Mouse/Lightpen)
- RuMSX saved state could not be restored by
  (a) dropping the file on it
  (b) selecting "Open with RuMSX" in context-menu
- Version number resource is now real version-number
  (instead of "1.00 Beta")
- Improved Z80-debugger (added Register-Dump, ...)

Build 19:
- Write to physical disk failed on Windows NT
- "phantom" frame remained on screen,
  if RuMSX was closed while running in
  fullscreen-mode (by pressing Alt+F4)
- RuMSX crashed if closed while DirectInput-device
  (mouse, joystick, ...) was active
- Some incorrect links in MSX-Basic documentation
  corrected
- Physical disks can now be really formatted
  (previously only sector-data was written)
- QuickFix for incorrect VDP-behaviour if
  X-coordinates and sizes are out of range
  (SD-Snatcher is fully working now;
  thanks to okei, okei@mvi.biglobe.ne.jp)
- Fixed VDP-commands YMMM and HMMM, which
  incorrectly moved memory-blocks to the left
  and/or upper direction, (bug was new since V0.17)
  "Emerald Dragon" works better now.
- Fixed handling of VDP read/write-adresses
  (Fony Demo-Disk 1 is fully working now),
  updated VDP-documentation accordingly
- Failed to change default disk-format for
  corrupted or copy-protected disk-images or
  floppy-disks (in "Devices" property-page)
- If keys are used for Joystick-emulation,
  these keys were not pre-selected if "Devices"
  property-page was opened again
- Internal changes in VDP and debugger-routines,
  unassemble-command fixed, dump-command added,
  Z80-exceptionhandler fixed
- Minor corrections in handling of system-errors
  (text-buffers were too short)
- Documentation for UZIX added (operating system),
  corresponding URL added to MSXLINKS.HTM
- Fixed incorrect handling of IM2,
  which prevented UZIX from being running
- MSX2TXT-filter added, to be used for conversion
  of MSX-specific text to DOS-text or Windows-Text
- Arnaud's (TFH) E-mail address & homepage changed
- MSX-DOS 2.31 is working now!
  (thanks to Kazuhiro Tsujikawa for patching the ROM)
  Note: MSXDOS23.ROM is updated. If InstallShield is
  not used RUMSXIMG.ZIP must(!) be downloaded for use,
  otherwise MSX-Turbo R configuration does not work!
  MSXTROLD-configuration contains previous slot-layout.
- RuMSX sometimes freezes if rebooted while
  (any) verbose debug-output was active.
- Requesting new configuration in troubleshoot-dialog
  sometimes caused removal of last saved setting.
- SaveState/LoadState support is working now

Build 18:
- RuMSX was not able to find required files,
  if started from Windows NT command-prompt.
- RuMSX caused lockup of the Windows NT shell (SP4),
  if new instance was started after 1st one closed
  (problem was related to the used sound-driver).
- VDP processes now also commands in screens-modes
  less than screen 5 (only if CMD bit set).
- FullScreen display sometimes used an incorrect
  aspect-ratio if zooming is active.
  (depending on the currently used resolution)
- VDP failed to switch to PAL (50Hz)
  (this bug was new since RuMSX V0.15)
- Fixed problems during large debug-output
  (i.e. disassembly is performed)
  + Could not interrupt: Ctrl+C for break added
  + RuMSX did not terminate if closed during output
- HiRes drivers for Screen 5, 6, 7 and 8 added
  (drivers do currently not support sprites)
- MouseEmulation required DirectX 5.0,
  even if DirectX 3.0 would be enough!
- "MSX web links..." added to the help-menu
- KANA-LED did not work since RuMSX V0.16,
  fix includes general improvement of KANA-LED
- New topic "VDP behavior added" to the RuMSX help
  documentation. Changes of this documentation are
  still not implemented yet.
  Thanks to Alex Wulms for this VDP description!
- Compiler changed from Visual C++ 5.0 to 6.0a

  added for trouble-shooting. Where "/NoMMMidiOut"
  is not functional yet, "/NoMMWaveOut" can be
  used to disable Wave-Audio.
- RuMSX hangs if clicking on menu, toolbar or if
  trying to move window. Problem was detected on
  some Windows NT installations and depends on the
  used sound-driver.
  This bug (new since Build 13c) is fixed now!
- Errors during sound-init or strange coding may
  cause slowdown because of rapid output to
  debug-window.

- improved errorhandling and error-details
- Internal changes in VDP-Emulation to enable
  SaveState/LoadState support
- Inifinite tape-access fixed,
  which occured if incorrect load-filename specified
- new VIEWTAPE utility added to
  review contents of tape-images (*.cas files)

Build 14:
- MSX.EXE did not terminate fully if running
  on Windows NT, wave-device still occupied!

Build 13c (MAiN special version):
- PSG/SCC sound-quality improved!!
  (DirectSound no longer required)
- ROM-Type was not correctly detected if ROM-image
  was launched by double-clicking it!
  I.e. it was not possible to start MetalGear2 by
  double-clicking the icon (hang during startup).
- Bug in memory-manager fixed (in some cases
  an incorrect memory-type was assumed, this
  may also have caused memory-manager to fail)
- Hardboot deactivated floppy disk-access
  (resetted to disk-image usage)

  if drive is already locked
  (i.e. disk is being formatted)
- Data-changes on floppy disk were not
  automatically applied in the explorer
  (must be refreshed manually)

  changes are made from other programs
  (Windows NT implementation worked fine)
- Window-size description was reverse of the
  technical correct (i.e. 1:3 instead of 3:1)
- Portability-fixup for Alpha-Workstations

  on the next start the last used configuration is loaded.
  You can also modify and/or create new *.CFG files!
- MSXTR800 memory layout changed to fix problems
  with some software (GigaMix games using DM2, ...)
- SoftBoot in R800 mode resetted Turbo led,
  but kept turbo-mode on (enabled R800 caused
  strange behaviour of next started programs)

  + crash of Golvelius 2
  + too slow screen-updates
- ToolBar-button color-mismatch fixed
  (transparent bitmaps for safe syscolor-change)

Build 08:
- Video frequencies of 60Hz and 50Hz are now generating
  a different number of CPU-cycles between VDP-interrupts
- Reported videoprocessor-version depends
  on the active configuration (no longer max.),
  which causes programs to work now different

  which caused a lot of mapper-programs to crash)
- Transparent color handling fixed
- Performance settings enhanced and now saved
- Test-implementation of new device for 'superimpose'
  (MSX-Video computer, requires capture-card)
  Currently disabled because of increased
  MSX-Emulator initialisation time, therefore
  this feature will be added to the MSX-configuration

Build 07:
- Kanji-ROM emulation fixed,
