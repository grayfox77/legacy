LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
-----------------

ESCOFF
ESCON

These two routines are not listed in the library function section.
The details are as follows:

void escoff()

  Disables the run time system's break checking mechanism. By default
pressing ESC (STOP) twice will abort a program.

void escon()

  Enables break checking.


BUSYPR

The description of the function 'busypr' gives the returned value
incorrectly. It returns TRUE (non zero) if the printer is busy,
and zero if ready.



LINKING MACHINE CODE AND C
--------------------------

The macro 'cfunc' may not be used to call functions defined within
the same file. An additional macro 'rcfunc' (relocatable C function)
is provided for this. Use of 'rcfunc' requires the Maxam II assembler 
version 2.03 or above. It works in the same way as 'cfunc' which should 
always be used for external function calls.



MATHS LIBRARY
-------------

The mathematical library is not as yet available. Arnor C users having need
of this library, please inform us of this either with the return of their
registration card or separately by post, so that it may be forwarded as
soon as available.


EXAMPLE PROGRAMS
----------------

The following example C programs are provided on the disc (side 2):

PRIMES.C	a program to generate prime numbers
COPY.C		a program to copy a file
		- illustrates use of file I/O functions
REVERSE.C	a program to type the contents of a file backwards
		- illustrates the use of random access
BOUNCE.C	a simple bouncing ball program
