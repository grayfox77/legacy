I am working on an ASCII C (MSX-C) compatible graphics / msxbios library for 
HI-TECH C. This archive contains a testversion of it. Because I don't posess 
any sources of graphical programmes, and have never taken graphics seriously, 
I can't test these routines well. That's why I'm asking your help. If there 
are mistakes in some of the routines, then please let me know what is wrong 
and where.
