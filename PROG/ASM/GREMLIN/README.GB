    This is a brief description of the contents of the "Gremlin" package.
The files may be packed by any known method, but nothing may be purchased
for the  use of one  or another packing  program. If  this statement goes
against the will  and/or purpose of  the program you intend to  use, then
move to another packing utility (there are a  lot of freeware and  public
domain around, why  using  a commercial  one?) or let them  unpacked, but
gathered in the same medium. Thank you for your cooperation.

    The files that should be sent together with the package are:

    * "readme.gb": this "read me" file.

    * "gremlin.c": the disassembler file.

    * "gremlin.doc": the documentation file.

    * "gremlin.exe": executable for M$-DOS/Windows OS, compiled
      using DJGPP.

    * "allcodes.dat": this  is  a test  file containing all Z80
      and R800 valid and invalid op-codes.

    * "msxbios.mll": this is a list of all MSX, MSX2, MSX2+ and
      turbo R Main-ROM BIOS' labels and entry-points. It can be
      directly used with Gremlin.

    * "msxsbios.mll": this is  a list of all  MSX2 Sub-ROM BIOS
      entries (MSX has none and MSX2+ and  turbo R has the same
      as MSX2). It can be directly used with  Gremlin, but take
      care using it, because many routines have the same labels
      of MSX BIOS with different entry addresses. The  contrary
      is also  true, that  is, some  entry addresses match with
      some  of the  Main-ROM BIOS. It's better  to  use it with
      Gremlin's  parameter "O" active, so  you can check  later
      if  the matching was done well. Another alternative is to
      modify the  labels in a  way you  can  know they are from
      this  file and  not  from the "msxbios.mll" (for example,
      add "_sub" to all labels: SETGRP_sub, WRTVRM_sub etc.).

    * "msxbasic.mll": this is a  list of the  BASIC interpreter
      entry-points. They  are standard for MSX, MSX2, MSX2+ and
      turbo R. Some of them have  entry-points in  the BIOS and
      use the same labels, so  the kind  of problems that occur
      with the Sub-ROM label list may occur with this, too. The
      same solutions are valid, of course. The file  is divided
      in BASIC program manipulation and Math-Pack routines.

    * "msxwrkar.mll": this is a list of all MSX, MSX2 and MSX2+
      Work Area  addresses (I think turbo R  has the  same Work
      Area  configuration as  MSX2+, but I cannot  be sure  for
      I  found no  official documentation about  it). It can be
      directly used with Gremlin.

    * "msxdisk.mll": this  is  a  list of  some MSX-Disk access
      Work  Area  addresses  and  routines. I couldn't  find  a
      complete official list of entries, so I only included the
      ones I have documented.

    * "msxmusic.mll": this  is  a list of  all MSX-Music access
      routines.

    * "msxaudio.mll": this  is  a list of  all MSX-Audio access
      routines and Work Area addresses of its own memory.

    * "msxiomap.doc": this is  a list  of all  MSX, MSX2, MSX2+
      and turbo R I/O access ports according to ASCII standards
      (all  MSX should  follow it). This file is  a descriptive
      document, so it cannot be directly used with Gremlin, but
      used to help the disassembling  process or even to create
      customized lists.

    * "msxabios.mll": BIOS  is basically  a  set  of "jumps" to
      routines in  the BIOS ROM. While the BIOS entry addresses
      are  fix, their corresponding  routines  may and, indeed,
      change from version  to version. Some users, for whatever
      reason in the  Universe they  could find, if any, instead
      of  using  the standard  BIOS entries, call  directly the
      corresponding branch addresses of THEIR  machine ROM, and
      some even use internal entries in the middle of BIOS just
      to avoid a little more coding. The obvious result of such
      a messy  and nasty  programming  is  a  program that most
      likely won't  work with  many, or  at  least  some, other
      computers  around. So, this  file tries to clear  some of
      all  those  garbage  left  in  such  programs, presenting
      the alternate  entries for  MSX (MSX2, MSX2+ and  turbo R
      programs  are generally  better coded and  don't need any
      repair). It does  not  include the internal  entries, for
      they have no corresponding standard entry-points in BIOS.


    Not all replaced values, of course, will  match the meaning. Just for
example, the BIOS  entry  0000H is called CHKRAM and is basically the MSX
"bootstrap" (initialization) routine, but the value 0000H is largely used
simply to set a null  value to a pair of registers. Indeed, very  few are
the  routines that actually call or  branch to CHKRAM. Thus, you can edit
"msxbios.mll" and remove  CHKRAM label, so the 0000H  values of  programs
will be  more properly  disassembled. I really only kept CHKRAM and a few
other labels for "academic purposes", so to  say (maybe someone, someday,
somewhere, would stop  and ask "By the way, what was  the  MSX  bootstrap
routine called?"...)

    The files that can be directly used  with Gremlin (all except the I/O
map document) have their entries and corresponding addresses separated by
the following symbols:

    = MSX and successors;

    % MSX2 and successors;

    # MSX2+ and successors;

    $ turbo R;

    * disk-driver access;

    ^ disk-driver access (in MSX-DOS mode);

    ** Disk-ROM address;

    & MSX 2, disk-driver, MSX-Music, MSX-Audio and other systems;

    ! MSX and  successors, except turbo R, because the  devices
      they controlled and accessed probably became optional and
      cannot be found in any commercial machine:

      * Tape Data-Corder;
      * Paddle;
      * Light-Pen.

    ? unofficial label. Some entries have no official label, so
      I created one upon their names:

      * Character Set Base Address            = "ChrSet"
      * VDP Base Read Port                    = "VDPRd"
      * VDP Base Write Port                   = "VDPWr"
      * MSX ROM Version Identification Bytes  = "MSXVId"
      * Secondary Slot Select Register        = "ScSltR"
      * Disk Data Transfer Area (DTA) Pointer = "DTAPtr"
      * File Control Block (FCB) Pointer      = "FCBPtr"

    ?? alternative entry: use the official BIOS entry instead.


    Those symbols, as most others, are ignored by Gremlin, so they may be
changed if wanted (read the Gremlin source/documentation file).

    A note about the official labels: most of them are up to 6 characters
long, but there are a few that are  not in the "msxdisk.mll" and  most in
"msxaudio.mll".

    And finally, if you couldn't compile the program, if it presented any
problem, if you want  some  option not available or simply if you want to
