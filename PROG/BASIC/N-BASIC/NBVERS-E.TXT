Version information file for NestorBASIC 1.xx
By Nestor Soriano (Konami Man), December 2.004


* Changes from NestorBASIC 1.11 to NestorBASIC 1.10

Internal changes:

- The method for detecting the presence of InterNestor Lite has been updated 
to the new method required by InterNestor Lite 1.0 (see function 86 
description of NestorBASIC manual for details).


* Changes from NestorBASIC 1.0 to NestorBASIC 1.10

Internal changes:

- Corrected a bug in function 54 (graphic decompression), which caused the 
graphics to be always decompressed on the VRAM block 1.
- Corrected a bug that caused function 80 not to work under DOS 1.
- Corrected a bug that caused the sequence of loading NestorBASIC, 
uninstalling it, CALL SYSTEM, returning to BASIC, and CALL SYSTEM to fail 
(the last step caused the computer to hang, or did not return to DOS).
- Corrected a bug that caused the computer to hang when entering a 
turbo-block in Panasonic WSX computers.
- Sound chips are now searched only once, when NestorBASIC is installed. 
Previously, a sound chip search was made every time a replayer was loaded 
with function 71.

Functionality changes:

- Added function 86 (InterNestor Lite routine execution).
- Now function 72 (obtain information about the music being replayed) always 
returns information about the sound chips detected in parameters P(9) to 
P(11), even when no music replayer is loaded.

Documentation changes and other:

- Added section 9.4 (Using InterNestor Lite).
- Added the sample program TCPCON-L.NPR (TCP console for InterNestor Lite). 
The InterNestor Suite version, TCPCON.NPR, has been renamed to TCPCON-S.NPR.


* Changes from NestorBASIC 0.07 to NestorBASIC 1.0

Internal changes:

- The routine for correct detection of all mapped memory under DOS 1, 
previously distributed as a sepparate file (NBPATCH.BIN), is now built-in on 
NestorBASIC main file, NBASIC.BIN.
- Now external japanese FM-PACs are correctly detected.
- In previous versions, when a reset was made with NestorBASIC installed and 
DOS 1 present, it was not possible to load again NestorBASIC (an "Illegal 
function call" error appeared); a hard computer power-off was needed. Now 
this is corrected.
- Corrected a bug in the routine for calling routines in segment 5 (for the 
music replayer). Calls were made to the physical segment 5, instead of the 
logical segment 5.
- Corrected a bug in the routine that checks if there is a music replayer 
installed: now it checks if logical segment 5 actually exists before trying 
to check if it contains a replayer.
- Corrected a bug in function 71 (Moonblaster replayer install). Now 
autodetect option (when P(0)=3 at input) works correctly.
- Wavekit load routine has been modified to use NestorBASIC buffer segment to 
store temporary data, instead of using NestorBASIC segment itself.
- Now function 10 does not hang the computer when the block size to be 
transferred has length zero.
- Corrected a bug in function 62, that occasionally caused Syntax Error in 
normal BASIC when the string to be retrieved had length zero.

Functionality changes:

- The roles for segments 2 and 4 have been swapped: now segment 2 is the page 
2 BASIC RAM, and segment 4 is the internal buffer used by NestorBASIC.
- Functions 58 and 59 (machine code routines execution) now return the A 
register output value in P(12), in addition to returning it in the high byte 
of P(2).
- Function 58 now does not check that the address of the routine to be 
executed is in the range 0-&H3FFF when P(0)=0 at input. This means that now 
this function can be used to execute not only BIOS and SUB-BIOS routines, but 
also any routine placed on p
age 2 or on page 3.
- Function 71 (music replayer load) now also allows to uninstall the 
replayer, by using P(0)=-1 at input.
- Added functions 80 to 85.
- Added new routines and variables usable by the user machine code routines 
(GETF01 and the ones following).
- From now on, at least 600 free bytes are guaranteed at the end part of the 
NestorBASIC segment.
- If NestorMan is installed, segment 4 is reserved using NestorMan functions. 
Therefore, that segment is common to NestorBASIC and NestorMan.

Documentation changes:

- Descriptions for functions 58, 59 and 71 have been expanded, in orded to 
reflect the changes made on these functions.
- Section 3.1 and function 49 description have been modified, now they 
mention function 80.
- Added descriptions for the new functions 80 to 85, and for the new routines 
and variables usable by the user machine code routines.
- Added section 9, "Interaction with NestorMan and InterNestor Suite". The 
section that describes the functions has now the number 10.
- References to Moonblaster for Moonsound FM version have been supressed, 
since this replayer will never be implemented.
- References to konamiman@geocities.com have been changed to 
konamiman@konamiman.com.
- Made some minor corrections and cosmetic improvements.
