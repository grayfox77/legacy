      MSX PAINT 4  - Version 4.00. Author notes.


WHAT IS MSX PAINT IV?
---------------------

        MSX PAINT IV is a graphics utility to be used on a MSX2
computer with 256Kb of main memory and 128Kb of video memory. It
should be used with two disk drives. With this program you can create
art on any MSX2 screen, from 5 to 8. It even can be used to design
STAMPS for the Dynamic Publisher.


USING THE MOUSE
---------------
        The left mouse button is used to execute commands and to
select from the menus. The right button is used to call the menus. The
menus pop up at the center of the screen. The right button is also
used to return from some commands.


KEYS
----

SPACE: is used to select the colour under the cursor (only DRAW and
COPY programs.) 
F1: is the UNDO key. 
F2: saves the last changes so as it can not be undone by the F1 key. 
F3: changes the coordinates colours (only DRAW and COPY programs.)

MORE HELP
---------

I just hate manuals, so I will not write a manual for this program. If
you need more help using this program then send me a note, write a
letter or send me a disk with your troubles. All the commands are
selected from the menus, and some of them (like in ANIMATE and
SLIDESHOW) are written in a logical order. For example to create a
slideshow: first you should SELECT the pictures, then you should EDIT
your slideshow, and then you should SAVE your slideshow before running
it!

You may write to me in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, English, German,
Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Catalan, Mallorquin or... (have I
forgotten someone?). Here is my address:

I put this program on the public domain. I mean that good programs
should be free! I have spent many hours writting this program, so I
hope it will be of some use to you.
