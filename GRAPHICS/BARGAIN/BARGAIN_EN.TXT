
	Lossless image compression tool BARGAIN 14.22 for MSX2

		  Copyright(C)1990-2012 KATSU


  << Content explanation >>

 This is a MSX2 software that can view the screen 0-12 images by lossless compression.
 It corresponds to a logical operation, the interlace display, and the encryption.

-(SELECTÅ®TAB) was changed to drive the Select button.

  << Corresponding model >>

 Since MSX2 (VRAM128KB) Disk BASIC version 1.0/ 2.01


  << Collection file >> *It is necessary for execution.

*BARGAIN.BAS  	Image Compression and decompression BASIC main program.
*BN142.BIN    	Compression and decompression machine language routine.(Ultimate compression rate is valued)

-The following plug-ins are necessary for decompressing the image compressed previous version.
  BN135 /124 /116 /108 /96 /89 /79 /69 /39 .BIN


  << How to use >>

 <BASIC> run "bargain.bas"


  << Key corresponding to function >>

****** Browser screen ************************************************************

 < CURSOR >
 The file is selected with the cursor key.
 < CURSOR + SHIFT >
 Two or more files are specified putting up !-mark. 

 < RETURN >
 The file is fixed. if it is a file 
 It advances to the compression screen which the preserved BSAVE (*.SC?).
 It advances to the decompression screen which the Bargain compression (*.BN?).
 If it is common code key (*.KEY), the key is selected. 

 < V >
 The compression version is switched.
 Plug-in of necessity: BN39.BIN (High speed is valued)

 < SELECT >
 The second drive is selected. A: to H:.
 Initial state = H: Or B:
 -The drive letter can be registered in DC$ of the 100th line according to the system requirements.

 < BS >
 The current drive is switched to the second drive.
 Initial state = A:

 < C >
 The file is copied in the second drive.
 -Those all if there is !-mark

 < M >
 The file is moved to the second drive.
 -Those all if there is !-mark

 < DEL >
 It deletes a file.
 -Those all if there is !-mark

 < R >
 The name of the file is changed.

 < Q >
 It ends and it returns to the command level of BASIC.

 < ESC >
 It ends and it returns to DOS.

 < T >
 The file of the compression origin is replaced with the file at the compression destination.
 Initial state = Off

 < D >
 The matrix mode is selected.
 Initial state = Normality
 [ ] Normality
 [.] Mix (The middle of normality and dither)
 [_] Dither (Effective in taking image of SCREEN8)
 -It always becomes YJK mode in SCREEN10 or more.

 < E >
 The encryption mode is made effective.
 Initial state = Off
 [ ]OFF
 [.]Common key (Encrypt it by the key file "*.KEY")
 [_]Permutation key (Encrypt it by the image that compresses or decompresses immediately before)
 -It is automatically made if there is no "LOCK.KEY" when the program starts. 

 < I >
 The interlace display is effectively done.
 Initial state = On
 -It is the maximum and the free space of 53KB is necessary for the work drive (H: Or A:).
 -The compressibility changes by on and off in the non-interlace image. 
  Especially, making to turning off tends to rise and to rise in the YJK image the compressibility.
		    ON     (OFF)
	PERRO.BNC   28,085 (28,026)
	MEGUMI.BNC  18,620 (18,644)

 < O >
 It overlaps it with the previous image.
 Initial state = Off

 < L >
 A logical operation is selected by order sending.
 Initial state = PSET
 < L + SHIFT >
 It selects it by reversely sending.
 -At PSET, the setting when compressing it is reflected.

 < 5-8,0-2,* >
 The image is browsed according to the screen mode.
 Initial state = *
 -It doesn't function for turboR if it is not Disk BASIC 1.0 

****** Compression screen ************************************************************

 < CURSOR >
 The range of compression is specified with the cursor key.

 < RETURN >
 When the starting point and the terminal are fixed, the image is compressed.

 < BS >
 The fixation of the starting point is canceled.

 < ESC /Q /BS >
 It discontinues and it returns to the browser screen.

****** Decompression screen ************************************************************

 < CURSOR >
 The starting point is specified with the cursor key.

 < RETURN >
 When the starting point is fixed, the image is decompressed.
 -The second piece doesn't decompress when some keys are pushed while decompressing the first piece of the interlace image.

 < DEL >
 The screen is deleted.

 < HOME /B >
 The image is preserved with BSAVE.

 < SPACE /INS >
 Condensed information in the image is seen.

 < SELECT /C >
 The image is compressed again. The specification of the range is omitted.
 < SELECT /C + SHIFT >
 The range of compression can be specified.
 -Because the encryption comes to encrypt oneself for myself (chicken and egg), it is invalid.
 -The re-compression of the encryption image is dangerous if it doesn't do after it forwards it to another drive.

 < ESC /Q /BS >
 It discontinues and it returns to the browser screen.
 

  << Notes >>

 A logical operation cannot be correctly done to the image into which the tile is compressed.
 It comes to be able to do correctly by the tile compression's being nullified if kinds other
 than PSET are chosen and compressed by the setting again.

 <C><M><DEL><R> The file operation can be done with the wild-card.
 Example) rename *.sr* *.sc*
 After inputting by <R> in a suitable place as *.sr* and doing <RETURN>
 It is corrected again by <R> in the place as *.sc*, does <RETURN>, and completion.

 The label of the interlace image is as follows.(?= 5, 6, 7, 8, A, B, C)
 ..page 0: (*.SC?) --> (*.BN?)
 ..page 1: (*.S1?) --> (*.B1?)

 The noise occurs to the interlace display when [B1?] is 6000 bytes or more larger than [BN?].
 At that time, please enlarge the value of VA+6000 of the 1550th line.
 Because [B1?] is encrypted, it cannot be decoded that [BN?] that becomes a key is not decompressed.

 If the permutation encryption function decompresses IROHANI.BN8 by <E> while turned on and compresses HOHETO.SC8,
 HOHETO.BN8 becomes an encryption image that cannot be decrypted not to decompresses IROHANI.BN8.
 Please note that all the encryption images following it never return to the origin earnestly 
 when the image that becomes the key to the encryption is deleted or is compressed again. (^c^;)

The common-key encryption is encrypted with the key that has been selected now. 
The re-compression with an encryption is also possible.

  << Postscript >>

 Interested chance in the image compression of me is software 'Easy Telopper' attached to HBI-F900.
 It was what the HAL laboratory developed aiming at SONY in 1986, and being possible to do of the graphic editor was the wonderful one.
 I have felt admiration especially for can increase the capacity of the disk by an original compression format 'G-Editor'.
 I think that it was motivated that only the impression at that time created the Bargain compression though the compressional effect is insignificant now.

 I never thought that it took as many as 21 years by completion •••. It is surprised for myself as I (^^;)
 Thank you for the dream and impression. It dedicates it to all people who love MSX. Completion!
