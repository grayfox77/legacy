PCX Viewer 1.0
by Ricardo Bittencourt

This is a very simple PCX Viewer for SCREEN 8.
The source compiles under RBC v1.3 or higher.

The viewer has many limitations:

- PCX must be a 24-bit image
- image size must be less than or equal to 256x212
- it uses uniform quantization, without dithering

To use it, just type:

PCX <file>

In the example included, this should be:

PCX MINMEI.PCX

Any troubles, bug reportings or suggestion must be 
sent to ricardo@lsi.usp.br
