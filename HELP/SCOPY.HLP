SCOPY
-----

Format:      SCOPY source destination 

Purpose:     Copies data  from a  source file to a destination file, 
        only if the destination file did not exist yet.

Use:         The  definition of  both the source and the destination 
        is:

                   [d:][path]filename

             SCOPY  first  checks  if the  destination file  already 
        exists.  If not,  the source file will be copied to the des- 
        tination file.

             Note that SCOPY is a transient command, and must there- 
        fore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

        SCOPY A:\COMMAND2.COM H:\COMMAND2.COM

             If  the file  COMMAND2.COM was  not found  in the  root 
        directory  on  drive H:,  it will  be copied  from the  root 
        directory on drive A:.

        SCOPY A:\UTILS\TREE.COM H:\DIRTREE.COM

             If  the  file  DIRTREE.COM was  not found  in the  root 
        directory on drive H:, then the file TREE.COM will be copied 
        from  the directory \UTILS on drive A:, with the new name of 
        DIRTREE.COM.
