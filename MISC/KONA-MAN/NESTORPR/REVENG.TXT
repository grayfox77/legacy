--- NestorPreTer revision information file
--- Version 0.3, December 1999


* Changes in version 0.2 (November 1999):

- Corrected a bug: when line indent was used to continue new physical line in 
the current line number, the previous quotation state was ignored and reset. 
That is, this text:

Print "Use Nestor
       Basic because it is very nice!": goto ~~

is converted in version 0.1 to

10 PRINT"Use NestorBASICBECAUSEITISVERYNICE!": goto ~~

and in version 0.2 it becomes the correct:

10 PRINT"Use NestorBasic because it is very nice!":GOTO10

- Corrected a very stupid bug which caused macros placed at the very 
beginning of the input file to be corrupted when LIN parameter was specified.

- Corrected a bug which caused problems when using empty line labels (like 
~1234 in the samples of section 5): sometimes lines were mixed and the BASIC 
line number assignation of the other labels was not correct.

- Added the special label "~~", which refers to current BASIC line number. 
See section 5 on manual file.

- Manual text corrected: in section 3, when explaining /B parameter, it was 
written that "output file must be placed in the same directory of 
NestorPreTer"; this is not true, it has been corrected to "output file must 
be placed in the current directory".


* Changes in version 0.3 (December 1999):

- Added the /MAC option, so now you can use an external file for macro 
definitions. See section 3 on manual file.

- Added the [F] field in the error messages, which indicates an error found 
in the external macro files and not in the source text. See section 8 on 
manual file.

- Added a note about failures when defining too many macros, please read it 
in section 6.5 of the manual file.

- Now the minimum required segments under DOS 2 is three and not two.

- Corrected another nasty bug which caused wrong line numbering when 
directives were used together with the /LIN option.
