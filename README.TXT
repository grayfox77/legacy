How to use image files:

* If you want to use a 737280 or 368640 bytes .DSK, you can emulate it
  directly on fMSX or BrMSX with the option '-diska filename.dsk'

* If you want to dump a 737280 bytes DSK onto a real diskette using your PC,
  use COPIA720. If the file is 368640 bytes long use COPY360.EXE instead.

* If you want to dump a 737280 bytes DSK onto a real diskette using your MSX,
  use COPY720.COM  If the file is 368640 bytes long use COPY360.COM instead.

How to use ROM files:

* If you want to load a .ROM file on your PC, you have to use any
  emulator and to give it the mapper kind of the .ROM if it is
  a MegaROM (>32K).

  In order to know the kind of the mapper you can use MAPPER.EXE
  in PCUTILS\

* If you want to load a .ROM file on your MSX, you have to use any
  ROM loader, as LOADROM.COM or MEGAMU.COM
  LOADROM.COM loads any 16K or 32K fine, but it has troubles with
  some MegaROMs. LOADROM uses ROM-SORT.DSC (contained in ROMs
  directories) to learn about the .ROM file (description and mapper
  info).

  Since LOADROM doesn't support reading from CD-ROM, you must copy
  .ROM file and ROM-SORT.DSC to the same path where you had your
  LOADROM.COM on your hard disk.
