This means that ifyou ask the DISKBIOS for sector 0-8 then it will need at least 2 rotationsto read them. Then it takes at least 64 seconds to read a disk on MSX.If you *KNOW* the interleaving then most newer MSX disk-bioses can actuallyread the disk in 32 seconds if your program doesn't have to move each sector.This depends greatly on the size of the gap between each sector and on howwell the diskbios was written.In that case you should read 1 sector at a time and in the order of theinterleaving.I rewrote/optimized the SVI-738 diskbios. After that it was faster to use PCformatted disks than MSX disks. Turbo R formatted disks are very slowthough because the gap between the sectors are 'too' short. (The TBR useinterleaving '1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9')The MSX can read 720k disks just as fast as any PC. It *HAS* to! or it wouldloose the data. The problem on the MSX is that you also need CPU powerenough to move/use the data and to go through the DOS/BIOS code.Newer PC's use faster drives which moves the head faster than the MSX. Ifyou use a PC diskdrive on a MSX and use a slow stepspeed then the drive willmake much more noise when stepping while if the FDC step faster then therewill much less noise.The 3.5MHz MSX is too slow to read 1.44MB disks when using FDC's like the 1793/2793 and the PC compatible FDCs which require the CPU to 'poll' foreach databyte. A 720K disk returns 31250 bytes/sec to the head (only 23040bytes are real sector data). A 1.44MB disk returns 62500 B/s.A good IDE or SCSI interface can return 120.000 B/s on a 3.5MHz MSX so it'sreally a matter of how intelligent the Drive/interface are.Bye,Henrik Gilvad <msx@login.dknet.dk>
