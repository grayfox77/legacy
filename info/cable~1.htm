Konami's RA 005, F1 Spirit 3D Special, incorporates a battle mode. 
Two MSX'es can be connected to one another via a special cable. 
This cable was sold seperately. I have never seen the real thing, 
so I've gathered this information from hacking the game. 
If you do have it, could you please compare it to this.
<P>
Note that F1 Spirit 3D Special is an MSX2+ game, so you'll need two 
MSX2+ computers or higher to use this cable. You'll also need two 
copies of the game (or two copies of disk B at least). 
<P>
The cable connects the MSX'es via the game ports. I must be put in 
port B of both computers. It is quite a simple interface. 
<P>
First of all, before two MSX'es can communicate, the grounds must be
connected. 
(connect pin 9 to pin 9.)
The cable uses seperate connections for communication every way. 
The three outputs are connected to three inputs both ways. 
(connect pin 6 to 1, pin 7 to 2, pin 8 to 3 and vice versa.)
<P>
See the picture at the right. I have built the cable and it seems to 
work fine.
