Alpha-C is a special subset of "BDS C", BD Software's commercial software
production package. Alpha-C was developed as a low-cost alternative to
BDS C for those users who do not require universal cross-compilation and
customization capabilities. While the syntax and operation of the compiler
itself are virtually identical to BDS C, Alpha-C does NOT provide for:

	a) Modification of the machine-language-coded portions of the
	   standard library and run-time package,
	b) Interactive debugging via the CDB debugging package (although
	   SID may still be used, if available, by interaction with the
	   symbol table output files produced by CLINK.COM),
	c) Floating point and Long integer library facilities,
	d) Compile-time user area library configuration facilities
	   (only useful when running on large scale hard-disk based systems).

		|  Special System-Dependent Cautions	  |	
		+-----------------------------------------+

There are two versions of the Alpha-C run-time package object module
supplied with the Alpha-C package. The standard module, C.CCC, assumes
that your computer system has implemented "user areas" (i.e., BDOS call
number 32 is "get/set user code"), and allows user number prefixes wherever
filenames are used during regular program execution.

If your system does NOT support user areas, then you MUST use the alternate
run-time package module CNOUSER.CCC instead of C.CCC. This is accomplished
by erasing the original C.CCC from  your work area, and renaming CNOUSER.CCC
to C.CCC. After this, user area filename prefixes will have no effect.
