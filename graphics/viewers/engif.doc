
			     ENGIF 1.22

			GIF encoder for MSX-2


New features in version 1.22: this version is for MSXDOS-2 only. Full
pathnames can be used. Disk transfer speeds have been increased.

New features in version 1.2: interlaced mode, batch mode, screen 6 and
screen 12 conversion


What is this program?
---------------------
ENGIF converts MSX-2(+) screens 5,6,7,8 or 12 pictures to GIFs
according to the Compuserve GIF87a standard. You'll save disk space
and be able to transfer pictures to other computer systems without
loss of information. Well, on screen 12 you'll lose some, because
all colors must be translated to a 256-color GIF palette. Therefore
all screen 12 pictures are translated to screen 8. Putting 19.200
colors in a GIF palette would be impractical because of the size
of such a palette alone (60 kB).

Why GIF?
--------
GIF saves disk space compared to BSAVEd MSX pictures. It is the most
portable graphics file format in the world today. There are GIF
viewers and packers for MSX, PC, Apple Macintosh, Atari, Acorn,
Commodore and lots of other home computers. GIF offers a way of
showing your pictures to other people no matter what computer they
have.

How do I view GIFs on my MSX(2)?
--------------------------------
There are some programs in the public domain that can show GIF
pictures on MSX-2, MSX-2+ and Turbo-R. Look for SHOWEM, GIFSHOW of
GIFPLUS. Consult your sysop if you can't find them, or look for a
copy of Sunrise Disk Magazine #8 (1993).

How do I make GIFs on my MSX(2)?
--------------------------------
As far as I know, ENGIF is currently the only GIF packer which runs
under MSXDOS. Be sure to save your pictures to disk in BLOAD,S
format (see your MSX-BASIC manual if you don't know what this means).
If you have changed the color palette of a screen 5,6 or screen 7
picture, you must save this as well. Then invoke ENGIF from the MSXDOS
commandline:

   A>ENGIF filename.sc5 /Pfilename.pal /screennumber /other options

The screennumber defaults to 8. So if you want to convert a screen 8
picture, all you need to type is:

   A>ENGIF filename.ext

The picture with the name "FILENAME.EXT" will be loaded and converted
to "FILENAME.GIF". The screen will show some information and instructions.
If you don't want to press a key after loading the picture (e.g if
you are converting al lot of pictures through a batchfile), add the
commandline switch /B for batchmode.

Other screens than screen 8 must be defined: /5 for screen 5, /7 for
screen 7, etcetera.

	ENGIF filename.sc7 /Pfilename.pal /7 /I

Convert screen 7 picture "FILENAME.SC7" to "FILENAME.GIF" using the
colors defined in FILENAME.PAL. The /I option saves the GIF file
in interlaced order.


System requirements
-------------------
You need a MSX-2 computer with at least 128kB RAM and 128kB VRAM and
the operating system MSXDOS version 2.2 or higher. 7MHz or a Turbo-R
and a large ramdisk are nice for speed.


Warning
-------
make sure there is enough space left on the disk you want to save a GIF
picture on. Disk writes are not checked. If there is not enough space,
ENGIF will crash. Use of a ramdisk is preferred (for speed).

Future
------
I do not intend to make any customization or enhancements unless some
serious bug turns up. You have the source (it should be in the archive
you found the program in), now do with it whatever you like.

ENGIF is public domain software by Pierre Gielen, 3..5/1994. Special
thanks to Roderik Muit for help with the screen 12 conversion
routines.
