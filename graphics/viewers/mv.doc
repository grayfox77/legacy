                        ============================


MF is the program that allows you to view easily your .MIF pictures on your
MSX. It must be run from DOS. The syntax is the following :

        MV <File_Spec> | <-f ListFile>

        File_Spec may contain wildcards.
        ListFile is a text file.

The standard usage of MV is MV <File_Spec>.

Examples of this use :

       - MV * will display every .MIF files in the current directory
       - MV A* will display every .MIF files beginning with A in the
                current directory.

Note that the file extension is always set to .MIF, even if you specify
another thing in <File_Spec>.

The problem of this use is that you are not sure of the apperance order
of the files. This use is very handy for Multi Mente, that you can configure
to use MV.COM as the standard .MIF viewer.


The ohter use of MV.COM is using -f <ListFile>. <ListFile> is a text file,
that contains the name of the .MIF files to load, in order. In this way,
you are sure of the appearance order. This is handy for creating
your own slide shows.

Imagine that the file MYSLIDE.TXT contains this :

FISHES
TURTLES
LION
CAT

if you type : MV -F MYSLIDE.TXT, the files FISHES.MIF, TURTLES.MIF, LION.MIF
and CAT.MIF will be displayed.

MV.COM is public domain, you can distribute as you want. Have Fun !
