				     Options

       At the OPTION menu (graph-O) you can install ORACLE at your wishes.
       There are few sub-menus like:

       o Chips
	 Select the hardware-chips to use.
       o Amplifier
	 Adjust the output volume to stereo as you wan'it.
       o Enviroment
	 Several installation buttons are found here (see other pages)



				      Chips


       Here you can swith 4 types of hardware chips ON or OFF.

       o MSX Music	(also known as "FM-PAC")
       o MSX Audio	(also known as "Music Module")
       o Sample 	(the ADPCM channel of MSX Audio)
       o PSG		(The standard MSX sound chip)

       Each type has his own control-switch.
       Do I need to explain more? Don'think so!


				    Amplifier

       This  option is	used to set a correct BALANCE between the selected 
       hardware chips (see "Chips").
       Each type has its own volume limit which is set at max #3F.

       Since  my  MSX  Audio  output  is  louder than my MSX Music and the 
       PSG overrules everything I have set the volumes as follows:

			       MSX Music #3F
			       MSX Audio #37
			       Sample	 #3F
			       PSG	 #27

				   Enviroment

       Here are four sub menus:

       o Track setting
       o Interface
       o Screen
       o Printer

       The INTERFACE  section contains 3 other submenus and is intented to 
       setup the user-communication with Oracle.



				 Track settings

       In  this section you can alter the Track format as you like it when 
       giving a NEW command.
       A  maximum  of  32 (#20)  channels can  be selected, with a maximum 
       resolution of 16 (#10) rows per pattern.

       The chip setting per channel can be altered with ........
       





			     Interface -> Dir Window













			       Interface -> Editor


       The following  options are  for any Editor (e.g. Pattern/Instrument 
       editor):

       o Position_Editor return with pat (On/Off)
	 Set  ON  if  you want	to link  the position_edit  cursor to  the 
	 pattern_edit position.

       o Position_Editor hide unused positions (On/Off)
	 When OFF, the pos.editor shows all 256 positions else if will
	 only display the positions marked by the SONGLENGTH.

       o Update instr.list after instrument edit (On/Off)
	 If  On,  the  INSTRUMENT/DRUM	LIST  will  be	updated after  the 
	 corresponding editor has been accessed.

       o Total channels to display (1-9)
	 Looks very clear to me (can also be set with [SPACE] + [1]/[9])

       o Empty effect display characters.
	 Here you can decide which character you want to see when a step 
	 does not use the effect collumn. Standard is shows to zerroes.
