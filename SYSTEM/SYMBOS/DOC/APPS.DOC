SymCommander is designed like the windows clone of the good old Norton

4.) SYMSHELL

SymShell provides commands like CD, DIR, REN, MD, DEL etc. and can directly
start GUI (*.EXE) and shell (*.COM) based applications. Shell based
applications use SymShell as an in- and output terminal. Batch files (*.BAT)
are supported and can be executed with the Shell. Size and colours can be
easily reconfigured. SymShell uses the new direct screen access support of
SymbOS. SymShells text output is the fastest possible solution for the CPC in
Mode 2, but slowed down a little bit by all the different layers. Redirection
is possible in both directions (input and output), and also appending is
supported. Piping is not yet implemented, but because of the multitasking it
will even be possible without slow temporary files (like in MS-DOS). You
already can start multiple applications inside the shell at the same time.

Options

If you execute a command you can always redirect the input and output to a
file. You can also start multiple applications in the same shell at the same
time.

"<" Input redirection
    [command and command parameters] < [filename]
    Instead from the keyboard, the command will receive all input from the
    file [filename].

">" Output redirection
    [command and command parameters] > [filename]
    Creates or empties the file [filename] and writes all output of the
    command into this file.

">>" Output redirection with appending
    [command and command parameters] >> [filename]
    Creates or opens (if existing) the file [filename] and writes all output
    of the command at the end of this file.

"&" Focus returns to the shell at once
    [shell application.com and parameters] &
    If you start a shell application ("*.COM"), you can force the focus to go
    back to the shell at once, even if the application is still running.
