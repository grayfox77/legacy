The system manager is responsible for starting and stopping applications and
for general system jobs. It provides several dialogue services and it owns the
file manager, which can only be accessed via the system manager process (for
more information see the "file manager" chapter).
System manager commands are triggered via a message, which has to be sent with
RST #10 (MSGSND) to the system manager process. The system manager process
always has the ID 3.

Description:    [General]
                In SymbOS "shared service" is the name for a special kind of
                program, which provides a collection of functions for any other
                application.
                Regarding the structure, a shared service itself is nothing
                else than an usual application. The difference is, that it
                mostly runs in the background without beeing visible and has an
                unique identifier with which it can be found or even started by
                any other application with the help of this function.
                A shared service should be able to provide its function to
                multiple applications at the same time. One example for a
                shared service is a network "demon", which supports existing
                network hardware like ethernet or RS232 cards and provides
                different network functions. Another example would be a
                graphic library. In general any access to additional hardware
                components, which is not directly supported in the SymbOS core,
                should be handled via shared services.
                This function can be used to find, start and release shared
                services. It can also be used to find any other application via
                the first 12 chars of its name. This makes it possible to
                prevent the execution of multiple instances of the same
                application: The second one will first search for itself and
                quits itself at once, if it's already running.
                This function also supports the handling of platform specific
                shared services. Depending on the computer type, there will
                probably be different types of hardware extensions, but they
                all provide the same functionality. So as an example, the MSX
                requires a different "network demon" shared service than the
                CPC. But as the applications doesn't need to know about the
                current platform, SymbOS will load the correct shared service
                automatically.
                [Usage]
                There are three command types for handling shared services and
                searching for applications.
                A.) For type 0 (search) and 1 (search, start and use) you have
                to specify the identifier string of the application (P1, P3).
                This identifier string is nothing else than the first 12 bytes
                of its name (inside the 256 byte header, please see the
                "Application" chapter). SymbOS will search for such an
                application and return the applications and process ID, if
                found.
                B.) Type 1 (search, start and use) will not only search for a
                shared service. If it can't be found, it will try to start it
                from the system path. Because of this, the shared service ID
                always have to be the first 12 chars of its filename
                ("%NNNNNNNN.EE"; please use exactly this format, fill the "N"s
                and "E"s and use always 8 chars for the main filename and 2
                chars for the extension). SymbOS will add a platform specific
                letter as the 13.char. This letter is...
                - "C" for the CPC,
                - "M" for the MSX,
                - "P" for the PCW,
                - "E" for the Enterprise (*not existing yet*),
                - "S" for the Sam Coupe  (*not existing yet*)
                ...version. This makes it possible to have different shared
                services for each platform.
                If the shared service could be found or started, a counter will
                be increased. This counter specified the number of application,
                which are using this shared service. It helps to find out, if
                a shared service is used or if it isn't used at all by any
                application.
                C.) Type 2 (release shared service) will decrease the mentioned
                counter. If it comes down to 0, the shared service will be
                removed completely. An application, which doesn't require a
                shared service anymore (maybe because it also have been
                quited), should send this command type. That means, that SymbOS
                always knows, how much applications are using a special shared
                service. If no one is using it anymore, it can be removed to
                free system resources.

                Command type 1 ("search, start and use") will return 0 (OK) if
                the shared services has been found or loaded successfully. In
                the other case it will return a loading error code of 1, 2, 3
                or 4, which is identical with these of MSR_SYS_PRGRUN.
                Command type 2 ("release") will always return 0 (OK).

                (see MSR_SYS_SYSWRN).
                Please note, that the content data must always be placed in the
                transfer ram area (#C000-#FFFF). The texts itself and the
                optional graphic must always be placed inside a 16K (data ram
                area).
                As the text line pen, you should choose 1, so 6 would be the
                correct value.

                02  1B  Number of the infobox window + 1. The application
                        should store this number as the super window ID of its
                        own window, so that the infobox will be handled as the
                        super window of the application window. As long as it
                        is open the application window can't get the focus
                        position.
                        For more information about the window data structure
                        and super windows see the chapter "desktop manager".
Description:    The system manager sends back this message to the application,
                when a infobox should be opened, or if the user clicked one of
                the buttons.

Description:    Opens the file selection dialogue. In this dialogue the user
                can move through the directory structure, change the drive and
                search and select a file or a directory for opening or saving.
                If you specify a path, the dialogue will start directly in the
                directory. If you append a filename, too, it will be used as
                the preselected file.
                You can filter the entries of the directory by attributes and
                filename extension. We recommend always to set Bit3 of the
                attribute filter byte.
                The File mask/path/name string (260 bytes) must always be
                placed in the transfer ram area (#C000-#FFFF). For more
                information about this memory types see the "applications"
                chapter.
                Please note, that the system will reserve memory to store the
                listed directory entries and the data structure of the list.
                With P10 and P12 you can choose, how much memory should be
                used. We recommend to set the number of entries between 100 and
                200 (Amsdos supports a maximum amount of 64 entries) and to set
                the data buffer between 5000 and 10000.

                01  1B  Message type
                         0 -> The user choosed a file or directory and closed
                              the dialogue with "OK". The complete file path
                              and name can be found in the filepath buffer of
                              the application.
                         1 -> The user aborted the file selection. The content
                              of the applications filepath buffer is unchanged.
                         2 -> The file selection dialogue is currently used by
                              another application. It can only be opened once
                              at the same time. The user should close the
                              dialogue first before it can be opened again by
                              the application.
                         3 -> Memory full. There was not enough memory
                              available for the directory buffer and/or the
                              list data structure.
                         4 -> No window available. The desktop manager couldn't
                              open a new window for the dialogue, as the
                              maximum number of windows (32) has already been
                              reached.
                        -1 -> The dialogue has been opened successful and the
                              user is doing his file selection right now.
                - if P1 is -1:
                02  1B  Number of the dialogue window + 1. The application
                        should store this number as the super window ID of its
                        own window, so that the file selection dialogue will be
                        handled as the super window of the application window.
                        As long as it is open the application window can't get
                        the focus position.
                        For more information about the window data structure
                        and super windows see the chapter "desktop manager".
Description:    The system manager sends back this message to the application,
                when a file selection dialogue should be opened.
                If opening was successful the application will first receive a
                type -1 message and then, after the user choosed his file or
                aborted, a type 0 or 1 message.
                If opening failed the application will directly receive a type
                2, 3 or 4 message.
