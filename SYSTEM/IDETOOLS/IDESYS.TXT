THE ROM IDENTIFICATION
----------------------

All IDE biosses have the following 3 characters at address #7F80/1/2:
ID#

Since IDE bios 1.8, also the bios version number can be obtained. It is situated at address #7FB6/7/8:
Examples: #01 #80 #00 =version 1.80=version 1.8
          #01 #80 #04 =version 1.80beta4
          #01 #91 #00 =version 1.91

Older biosses have #FF #FF #FF.

The following piece of code can be used to see if the bios is at least version #1.80:

	...
	LD	HL,(#7FB5)	;#7FB6 to H
	LD	A,(#7FB7)
	LD	L,A		;#7FB7 to L
	INC	HL		;!!! if it is #FFFF, it will turn to #0000
	LD	DE,#0180+1	;when comparing also #0180 should be increased by 1
	OR	A		;clear carry
	SBC	HL,DE		;compare
	JR	C,too_old
	...

THE WORKSPACE
-------------

During the bootprocess the IDE interface allocates 6*8+6+12 bytes of workspace in page 3 to store its system variables. The address of the first byte can be found in the SLTWRK (#FD09) table. The element corresponding with the slot the IDE is in, will contain the start address of the IDE workspace.

* IDE workspace consists of:
+00..2F: 6 fields of 8 bytes, related to the 6 possible driveletters
+30..35: 6 device info bytes
+36..41: 12 bytes free space (used for ATAPI command packets)

* Drivefield consists of:
+0    :device codebyte
+1/2/3:partition start (24 bit sector number: 0...)
+4/5/6:partition length minus 1 (24 bit sector count)
+7    :additional partition info

* Device codebyte consists of:
bit 0: 0=this partition is located on the Master device
       1=this partition is located on the Slave device
bit 21:
    00=this partition is located on an ATA device (=harddisk)
    10=this partition is located on an ATAPI direct access device
    11=this partition is located on an ATAPI CDROM (not used yet)

bit 3: 0=the medium of this partition has been changed
       1=the medium of this partition has not been changed

bit 4: 0=this partition is in use
       1=this partition is not in use/disabled (see note)

bit 5/6/7: not used yet, don't alter them

notes:
-so, bit 2 indicates if it is an ATAPI device
-ATAPI direct access devices: Iomega ZIP, LS120SuperDisk, ...
-Bit 3 is used as disk-changed-flag for DOS2
-When bit 4=1 and bit 3=1: unexisting drive, not in use
-When bit 4=1 and bit 3=0: no medium present in drive

* Additional partition info consists of:
bit 0..5: not used yet, don't alter them
bit 6: 0=this partition is the boot partition (not used yet)
       1=this partition is not the boot partition (not used yet)
bit 7: 0=this partition is logically write-protected
       1=this partition is not logically write-protected

* 6 device info bytes consist of:
+0: number of heads Master (in case of ATA device)
+1: number of heads Slave  (in case of ATA device)
+2: number of sectors/cylinder Master (in case of ATA device)
+3: number of sectors/cylinder Slave  (in case of ATA device)
+4: devicetype codebyte Master device
+5: devicetype codebyte Slave device

*Devicetype codebyte consists of:
bit 0: 1=this device is an ATA device (harddisk)
bit 1: 1=this device in an ATAPI device (CDROM, ZIP, LS120, ...)
bit 2: 0=this device uses only CHS addressing
       1=this device supports also LBA addressing
bit 43:
    00=this device is a direct-access device (harddisk, ZIP, ...)
    01=this device is a CDROM
    10=reserved
    11=reserved

bit 765: not used yet, don't alter them


SOME USEFUL ROUTINES
--------------------

The following addresses are entries to some useful routines when doing tests with the IDE.

7F89: absolute sector read
      input: A=device codebyte (see above for description)
             CDE=24 bit sector number (E=lowbyte)
             B=number of sectors to read
             HL=destination address
      output: Carry=error, errorcode in A register (same as DISKIO)
7F8C: absolute sector write
      input: A=device codebyte (see above for description)
             CDE=24 bit sector number (E=lowbyte)
             B=number of sectors to write
             HL=source address
      output: Carry=error, errorcode in A register (same as DISKIO)
7FB9: select device: selects the Master or Slave device
      input: bit0 of A register: 0=Master 1=Slave
      output: Carry if controller time-out error
      changes: A,BC,IX,EI
7FBC: issue ATAPI packet (packet is sent to the selected device)
      input: HL=pointer to 12-byte ATAPI command packet (not in page1!)
             DE=transfer address for data (if any)
      output: NC=succesful
              C+NZ=error, A contains IDE errorregister contents
              C+Z=error, controller time-out
      changes: all

Notes:
*if data is transferred in page 0 or 1, this can only be from the primairy mapper ramslot.
*for the absolute sector read/write routines it is necessary that the IDE bios is installed during the MSX boot process. That is not needed for the other two routines.

Example:
	ld	a,1
	call 	selectdevice	;select slave device
	ld	hl,open
	call	packet		;this will open your CDROM tray!
	...
open	db	#1b,0,0,0,#02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

More info about ATAPI command packets can be found on the Internet. Look for 'SFF8020'. (example: 8020r26.pdf)
