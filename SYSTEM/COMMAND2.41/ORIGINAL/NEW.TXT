                 _CWP, _CWPS, _DATE, _DATEF, _DIRBUFFER, _DISK, _DOSVER,
                 _DOW, _ERROR, _FG, _FILECOUNT, _FNEXT, _MSXVER, _ROW,
                 _ROWS, _TIME

     - SET PROMPT defaults to %_CWD%>
     - commands IFF, THEN, ELSE and ENDIFF added. IFF is nestable up to
       16 levels.
     - any external command (file) may also contain wildcards. In that case 
       the first matching file will be executed.
     - SET EXPERT defaults to ON
     - command HISTORY added
     * command DSKCHK added
     - /P option added to commands ALIAS and SET
     - command line editor: CTRL-RETURN executes command without storing
       it in the buffer
     - command MEMORY added
     * MODE can also set screen height
     - in batch file %n& is available, which means every parameter from
       parameter n. n defaults to 1, so %& is the same as %1&.
     - the same applies to aliases: parameters are passed with %n. %n& is 
       also possible.
     - IF(F) also uses EQ, LT and GT instead of just ==
     - DIR option /2 added for two column output
     - instead of .BAT files also .BTM files. These are read into memory 
       completely (max. size 16K, min. 16K of free memory must be available).
       Within these .BTM files labels, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN and END are 
       possible.
     - command GOTO ~label added
     - command GOSUB ~label added
     - command RETURN [~label] added
     - command END added
     - example file COPY.BAT adapted using labels. See COPY.BTM.
     - IF(F) uses multiple equations combined with AND, OR or XOR. Maximum
       number of combinations depends on the length of the command line.
       Multiple equations are executed FROM THE LAST TILL THE FIRST.
       Parentheses are NOT allowed.
     - command ATTRIB also uses +A en +S (and -A en -S) to make a file
       system file or archived.
     - all commands expecting a compound-filespec, can also have /S to 
       allow system files to be found too
     - DIR also shows system files with an s (as opposed to h and r)
     - example file DIR.BTM added. Format: DIR.BTM [filespec]. Same as DIR
       command, only not so fast. Also shows file attributes.

NB.1:  DOS requires 4 pages of memory to work with (TPA memory). An extra 
       two pages are necessary for environment items, disk buffers and some 
       other information, so DOS needs 6 pages (=96K) to work with. 
       COMMAND2.COM version 2.40 requires 1 extra page for storing aliases 
       and the command line buffer. Starting a .BTM file also requires one 
       extra page, which makes a total of 8 pages (=128K) required to work 
       with. An MSX machine with only 128K has its entire memory used by 
       DOS. However, ending a .BTM file frees up one page of memory. A 
       machine with 128K has 16K free that can be used by other programs.

NB.2:  COMMAND2.COM version 2.40 is a European version, which means that 
       all Japanese texts are removed. Even in non-ank mode, English texts 
       are displayed. The only thing that can appear in Japanese, is an 
       error message since these come from ROM.

New in COMMAND2 versie 2.41 (release date: 04-12-97)

     - DIR /W shows directories in lower case
     - Mandatory variables are stored in alias-memory, which leaves more 
       space in TPA
     - Internal Variables added:
       _DRIVEMAP - Returns available drives as 8-bit value. Left is drive 
		   H:, right is drive A:
       _SHELL	 - Returns the shell-number of COMMAND2.COM. Original proú 
		   gram is 0, first shell is 1, etc.
     - Internal Variable Functions added:
       @READY	 - Returns 1 if specified drive is ready or a 0 if it is 
		   not ready, or an empty string when an error occurs
     - IF(F) can also compare expression with spaces. If so, a string needs 
       to be included in brackets { and }.
     - CTRL-TAB puts the new file behind the current one on the command 
       line
     - When in insert mode, cursor up and down put previous command lines 
       behind the current one
     - Special alias UNKNOWN_CMD added. It is executed when an *** Unrecogú 
       nized command error occurs. If this alias does not exist, then the 
       error is generated. Make sure that the alias itself does not raise 
       an *** Unrecognized command error, otherwise an unbreakable loop is 
       entered.
     - TAB is circular. After the last filename, the first one is displayed 
       again.
     - Environment item TABORDER added. This determines whether directories 
       or files are found and in which order. Its value can be:
       BOTH - both directories and file are found, in the order that they 
       appear on disk
	       FILE - only files are found
		DIR - only directories are found
	   FILE,DIR - first files are found, then directories
	   DIR,FILE - first directories are found, then files
     - HISTORY /D added to clear the history buffer
     - HISTORY n added to increase or decrease the history buffer size. n 
       must be between 128 and 4096.
     - Booting with HOME pressed, prevents AUTOEXEC.BAT from being executú 
       ed.

NB.3:  All version of Multi Mente, older than version 2.03, do not work 
       properly with this version of COMMAND2.COM. It is not possible to 
       open a shell from Multi Mente. Version later than 2.03 use another 
       algorithm (the right one) to open a shell, so that they can work 
       correctly with COMMAND2.COM version 2.41.

Known bugs removed from version 2.40:

     - The TIME command did not put an 'a' or a 'p' behind the time when in 
       12-hours mode.
     - When IFF was in a FALSE state and another IFF was given, the ELSE 
       statement could change the first FALSE state into a TRUE state. ELSE 
       now only applies to the IFF it belongs to, not to the previous IFF.
     - When removing quotes, the first character behind the quote was igú 
       nored. "''" was not converted to '', but "' '" worked just fine. The 
       first character is now no longer ignored.
     - The function @LABEL did not chech whether the specified drive was 
       valid. An invalid drive returned the last filename as a label. Now 
       an empty label is returned when the specified drive is invalid.
     - When a .BTM file was aborted with CTRL-C or CTRL-STOP, the occupied 
       memory was not automatically freed. Multiple abortions ended up 
       filling the entire memory. The memory is now released properly.
     - A .BTM file that did not end with a ^Z character (eg. when created 
       with COPY CON FILE.BTM) sometimes had unpredictable results. A ^Z 
       character is now automatically added when the file is loaded.
     - An executable extension of less than three characters was not 
       executed. Now extensions of one or two characters are also executed 
       properly.
