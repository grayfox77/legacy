    MSX-DOS 2 COMMAND version 2.41
    Copyright (c) 1997 by C.P.U.

    This is  the original  patch to rebuild COMMAND2.COM from version 2.20, 
    version  2.31 or version 2.32 to version 2.41. This patch is not Public 
    Domain, it	is only  meant for personal use and it may therefore not be 
    copied  and spread. You can also  can  find a  patched  version by Okei 
    with fat16  in  this directory. If you do not want to use that version, 
    you have the instruction to install original version in this document.

    To avoid  problems with  copyrights, this  new version  is release as a 
    patch.  You have  to own a copy of COMMAND2.COM version 2.20 or version 
    2.31 to patch it to version 2.41.

    COMMAND2.COM version  2.32 is  an adapted  version of 2.31. It was dis- 
    tributed  in Holland by Hardware Partners Nederland. It is not possible 
    to patch  version 2.32 directly. By running the program PATCH32.COM you 
    can  extract  COMMAND2.COM	and MSXDOS2.SYS  version 2.31  from version 
    2.32.

    Follow this procedure to extract COMMAND2.COM version 2.31:

    - Copy  the   file	PATCH32.COM   to  the	disk  and  directory  where 
      COMMAND2.COM and MSXDOS2.SYS are situated.
    - Start the program PATCH32.COM using: PATCH32
    - The  files COMMAND2.231  and MSXDOS2.231	have been  created on  your 
      disk.
    - Delete the files COMMAND2.COM en MSXDOS2.SYS.
    - Rename  to  file	COMMAND2.231  as  COMMAND2.COM	and MSXDOS2.231  as 
      MSXDOS2.SYS.

    To install COMMAND2.COM version 2.41, you follow this procedure:

    To start COMMAND2.COM from floppy disk:

    - Copy the files COMMAND2.COM and MSXDOS2.SYS to this disk.
    - Restart the  computer with  this disk in the drive. COMMAND2.COM ver� 
      sion 2.41 is installed automatically.
    - The new  COMMAND2.COM is	installed on  the disk.  The old version is 
      stored as COMMAND2.OUD

    To start COMMAND2.COM from harddisk:

    - Refer to the drive with the floppy disk and go to directory \ORIGINAL
    - Install  COMMAND2.COM  with  INSTALL.  INSTALL installs  COMMAND2.COM 
      automatically on	drive A:. If you want it to be installed some place 
      else,  enter the	new drive  and/or directory directly after INSTALL, 
      for example  INSTALL B:\COMMAND.	This directory needs to contain the 
      old version of COMMAND2.COM.
    - Drive A:	now contains  the new version of COMMAND2.COM. The old ver� 
      sion is stored as COMMAND2.OUD

    INSTALL   first  checks   whether  you   have  the	 right	version  of 
    COMMAND2.COM. Installing  is only  possible when  you have COMMAND2.COM 
    version 2.20 or 2.31.

    In the  file NEW.TXT  you can  read what  has been	changed in this new 
    version.  For more	details on specific commands I refer to the respec- 
    tive .HLP  files. These help-files describe the new commands of version 
    2.40, but they do not describe the new features of version 2.41.

    The files TO.COM and TREE.COM are now part of DOS version 2.41, and are 
    also  included in  this patchdisk. The old version of RRAMDISK.COM will 
    not run  under COMMAND2.COM  version 2.40,	therefore a  patch to  this 
    program  is also  included. The  new version  has no  features added or 
    removed.

    The files  DIR.BTM, COPY.BAT  and COPY.BTM are examples of the new pos- 
    sibilities	of batch  files. An  explanation of COPY.BAT can be read in 
    the help file IFF.HLP.

    The file  SETALIAS.BAT contains some useful aliases. Of course you have 
    to	adapt some  of the  parameters yourself.  When starting the file, a 
    file called  ALIAS.DAT will  be created  in the root directory of drive 
    A:. Add ALIAS /L A:\ALIAS.DAT to your AUTOEXEC.BAT to load the aliases, 
    so that you don't have to execute the time-consuming SETALIAS.BAT.


    For  questions and/or  remarks, if you have new ideas or find that some 
    features are  unnecessary, please  don't hesitate to let me know! Write 
    or e-mail to the address below.

    I hope that you will enjoy using COMMAND2.COM version 2.40!
