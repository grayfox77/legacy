     * Introduction *

Thank you for reading MM-E.DOC

MM  (which is short for Multi-Mente) is a program which is  intended  to 
allow you to control all files on a disk in an easy manner.

MM  needs  MSX-DOS 2 to work properly <note from  the  translator:  this 
isn't  checked,  however! It'll just crash under DOS 1.>


     * Starting MM *

Invoke MM using this command:

 MM <Drv:Dirctry> [RETURN]

The Drv: part specifies the chosen initial drive.
The Dirctry part specifies the chosen initial directory.

The  initial  drive  and directory may be omitted,  in  which  case  the 
default drive and directory will be used.
 

     * Environment items used by MM *

PROGRAM   Used by MM. Do not change.
HOME      Contains the HOME drive/directory (see the '/' command). 
SHELL     Used when executing a transient (i.e. external) program.
TEMP      Where to place any temporary files.
TMP       <Unclear - translator>
TIME      Display format for the clock (12 or 24 hour). The 24-hour mode 
          is used by default.

* Explanation of functions *

[A]ttribute    Modify date/attributes of a file or directory.

[C]opy         Copy files or directories.

[D]elete       Delete files or directories.

[E]dit         Edit a text-file.

[SHIFT]+[E]    Open a new text-file.

[F]ind         Put  the  cursor  on  the  next  file  (in  the   current 
               directory) which matches a particular name. Wildcards may 
               be used.

m[G]s play     Shows  all  files  with MGS-data.  (Doesn't  work  unless 
               MGSDRV is installed.)


[SHIFT]+[G]    It  is  possible to move the cursor and display  all  the 
               titles of MGS data currently in memory. (This only  works 
               with MGSDRV version 3.15 or higher.)

c[H]ange path  Changes work drive / directory.

ma[K]e dir     Create a new directory.

[L]og drive    Change the work drive.

[M]ove         Move  files / directories (e.g. move the tagged files  to 
               another directory).

re[N]ame       Change the name of a file / directory.

[CTRL]+[N]     Display disk-information.

[R]un          Run  a  program.  (MM  will  determine  how,  and  do  so 
               automatically, even if it's a batch-file.)

[SHIFT]+[R]    The same as [R]un. However, the treatment of the function 
               is extended.

e[X]ecom       Execute a DOS-command.

[SHIFT]+[X]    Make & execute a small batch-file.

[S]ort         Sort the files by type (only for display purposes).

[T]ree         Make a tree of the disk's directories.

[U]npac        Decompress all files in an archive file. If the extension 
               isn't  either  .ZIP .PMA .LZH .ARK .ARC or .COM  (a  DIET 
               file <he means POPCOM'ed - translator>) the file will  be 
               decompressed with ISH.COM.

[SHIFT]+[U]    Execute  the compressed file management utility  selected 
               during the configuration of MM. (Default is PMM.COM)

[V]iew         View  the contents of a file using the  utility  selected 
               during  configuration.  By  default,  the  built-in  VIEW 
               function will be used.
 
[SHIFT]+[V]    View  the contents of a file using the  utility  selected 
               during  configuration.  Initially, this will  be  set  to 
               VF.COM.

[CTRL]+[V]ol   Changes the volume name of the disk.

[W]ild card    Set the name template for displaying files. If nothing is 
               entered, MM will use '*.*'.

[CTRL]+[W]     Also use file attributes in the name template.

[SHIFT]+[W]    Tag files from the cursor position onwards. You may use a 
               wildcard name with this.

[I]sh          Translate into ISH format.
[CTRL]+[P]ma   Compress into PMA format.
[CTRL]+[L]zh   Compress into LZH format.
[CTRL]+c[O]m   Performs a DIET compression on a .COM file. <He means  to 
               POPCOM - translator.>

When  compressing in the PMA or LZH format, the archive-filename may  be 
omitted.  The name at the cursor position will be used with  the  extent 
PMA or LZH.

[0]..[8]       You  can change the drive by pressing a single key.  ([0] 
               reads the same drive again.)

[.] / [BS]     Change the work directory to the parent directory of  the 
               current one.

[/]            Change  to  the drive / directory indicated by  the  HOME 
               environment  item.  If this item doesn't  exist,  nothing 
               will happen.

[\]            Go  to  the  root directory. (If  you're  already  there, 
               nothing will happen.)

[RETURN]       Run   an  external  program,  depending  on  how  MM   is 
               configured. However, music files with the extension  .MGS 
               will  be  read  and played automatically,  if  MGSDRV  is 
               installed.

[SHIFT]+[RETURN]
               Edit  a  textfile  with the  editor  chosen  during  MM's 
               configuration (for instance, KID.COM).

[CTRL]+[RETURN]
               Execute   any  particular  utility  chosen  during   MM's 
               configuration. (For instance GEN80.COM to assemble a .GEN 
               file.)
                
[SHIFT]+[CTRL]+[RETURN]
               Edit  a  textfile  using the editor  chosen  during  MM's 
               configuration (for instance TED.COM).

[TAB]          Tags the file at the cursor position.

[SPACE]        Tags  the  file at the cursor position and skips  to  the 
               next file.

[SELECT]       Tags  all files. (If any files were already  tagged,  all 
               tags will be removed.)

[SHIFT]+[SELECT]
               Inverts all tags.

[CTRL]+[SELECT]
               Inverts all tags from the cursor position onwards.

The above three functions ignore directories.


[SHIFT]+[1]/[2]/[3]/[5]/[9]
               Change  the file display mode. (The number indicates  the 
               mode, except '9', which lets MM choose the display  mode, 
               depending on the number of files in the directory.)

     <Translators  note:  it doesn't quite work  that  way.  [SHIFT]+[2] 
     doesn't seem to do anthing at all, and to select the automatic mode 
     [SHIFT]+[0] must be pressed, which clashes with the function below. 
     Pressing [SHIFT]+[0] twice will do the trick, however.>

[SHIFT]+[0]    Change  the  display colours of the files.  (The  colours 
               depend on the file extent and attributes.)
 
[SHIFT]+[UP]/[DOWN]
               Move the cursor to the first or last file.

[SHIFT]+[LEFT]/[RIGHT]
               Change the display-page.

[CTRL]+[GRAPH]+[DEL]
               Perform  a 'shutdown' and then RESET the  machine.  (Take 
               care when using this.)

[HOME]         Performs a 'Shutdown' of a HDD. (This is the way to  stop 
               a  hard  disk.) <I doubt if it works on  a  European-made 
               SCSI-interface - the translator>


     * About moving the cursor around *

In   MM,  you  can  move  the  cursor  around  with   [CTRL]+[character] 
combinations in the following way:

[X]       Move downwards
[E]       Move upwards
[S]       Move to the right
[D]       Move to the left
[A]       A page backward
[F]       A page forward
[R]       Move to the first file
[C]       Move to the last file

The cursor can be moved in all directions


     * Explanation of VIEW *

[UP]/[DOWN]    Move a page up or down
[LEFT]/[RIGHT] Move ten pages
[SPACE]        Go to the next page
[BS]           Go to the previous page

If [SHIFT] is pressed simultaneously, the movement will be cut by half.

[H]ead         Go to the beginning of a text
[T]ail         Go to the end of a text

[B]inary       Set the binary mode ON or OFF. If it's ON, the file  will 
               be displayed beyond any 1AH-characters (or CTRL-Z), which 
               normally mark the end of a textfile.

[TAB]          Changes the width of a TAB-character (8 or 4). 

[C]trl code    Displays control codes in a different colour.

[R]eturn code  Displays a RETURN using a special, redefined character.

[A]nk mode     Use the ANK-mode for display <translator's note: you must 
               use  the  ANK-mode to display the  characters  above  128 
               properly on a European machine.>


[SHIFT]+[RETURN]
               Edit  a  textfile  with the  editor  chosen  during  MM's 
               configuration (for instance, KID.COM).

[CTRL]+[RETURN]
               Execute   any  particular  utility  chosen  during   MM's 
               configuration. (For instance GEN80.COM to assemble a .GEN 
               file.)
                
[SHIFT]+[CTRL]+[RETURN]
               Edit  a  textfile  using the editor  chosen  during  MM's 
               configuration (for instance TED.COM).

[RETURN] or [ESC]
               Return from VIEW

[SHIFT]+[V]    Use alternative viewer


[ B 8 C R A ]  in the upper  right-hand corner of the screen  shows  the 
state  of the Binary, TAB, CTRL, Return and ANK modes. The state may  be 
either ON or OFF, except for the TAB-field, which displays the number of 
spaces a TAB is expanded to.


     * About the directory tree *

[0] to [8]     Changes  the drive and displays the directory  tree.  The 
               numbers  1  to  8  correspond to the  drives  A:  to  H:, 
               pressing 0 re-reads the current drive.

[9]            Display the directory tree of all drives.

[L]og drive    Changes the work drive.

[UP]           Move the cursur upwards.
[DOWN]         Move the cursor downwards.
[LEFT]         Move to the top of the tree
[RIGHT]        Move to the bottom of the tree

[SHIFT]+[UP]/[DOWN]/[LEFT]/[RIGHT]
               When  pressing  [SHIFT] with any of the arrow  keys,  the 
               file  display  mode will be temporarily changed.  If  the 
               mode was ON originally, no files will be displayed  until 
               [SHIFT] is released, and vice versa.

[R]e search    Read  the  directory tree again. This function  will  not 
               read the .DIR file.

[W]rite        Write  the file MMTREE.DIR. Next time, this file will  be 
               read instead of building the directory tree from scratch, 
               which  can  be a lot faster. (The  file  MMTREE.DIR  will 
               always be written in the root directory.)

[F]ile         Sets  the file display mode ON or OFF. If it's on,  (some 
               of) the files in the current directory will be  displayed 
               in a window to the right of the tree.

[D]elete       Delete a directory.

ma[K]e dir     Create a new directory.
 
[TAB]+[?]      (The  [?] can be any character.) Moves the cursor to  the 
               next directory whose name starts with [?].

When  doing a COPY or MOVE, the directory tree of the current drive  can 
be displayed by just pressing [RETURN] when prompted for a  destination. 
With  the command '/?' - the ? stands for a drive letter ranging from  A 
to H - the directory tree of that particular drive will be displayed.

After  creating or removing a directory, the file MMTREE.DIR wil not  be 
updated automatically. If you wish to do so, issue a [W] command.


     * Data format of the directory tree *

The  data file is written by pressing a [W] when the directory  tree  is 
displayed. The data are formatted like this:

00 ?:\
01 ?:\UTILS
02 ?:\UTILS\FILE

The first digit is the direcory's attribute, which can be either  Normal 
(0)  or Hidden (2). The next digit shows the depth of the  directory  in 
the directory tree. If this exceeds 9, a code character will be used.

After  that,  there  is  a  space or  TAB  character,  followed  by  the 
directory's full path name.

The  '?'  stands for the current drive.  When you edit a file  like  the 
above using a text-editor you can change this, and insert directories on 
different drives, as in the example below.

00 ?:\
01 ?:\UTILS
00 H:\
01 H:\UTILS

To  speed up the reading of the directory tree, put the MMTREE.DIR  file 
as close to the top as possible in the root directory.


     * Basic commands for entering lines of characters *

[LEFT] or [RIGHT]
               Move the cursor.

[SHIFT]+[LEFT] Move the cursor to the start of the character string.

[SHIFT]+[RIGHT]
               Move the cursor to the end of the character string.

[INS]          Toggle overwrite/insert mode.

[DEL] or [CTRL]+[G]
               Delete the character at the cursor position.

[BS]           Delete the character left of the cursor position.

[CTRL]+[U]     Delete all characters left of the cursor position.

[CTRL]+[K] or [HOME]
               Delete all characters right of the cursor position.

[CTRL]+[SPACE] or [SELECT]+[GRAPH]
               Kanji  entering  mode.  (The usual  commands  are  used.) 
               <translator's note: the program crashed when I tried this 
               on my European-type computer!>


     * About copying *

If  you wish to interrupt the copying of files, press the [ESC]  key.  A 
'COPY STOP' menu will appear.

If  you  copy a directory, pay attention, because this makes a  copy  of 
every file in that directory.

When copying files, if a primary mapper exists, the unused part will  be 
used as a copy buffer. (Maximum 64 pages, or 1 Mbyte.)

When  copying  a directory, the buffer will get smaller as  the  program 
will get deeper into the  directory tree. 


     * If the name of a file is repeated *

Before  copying or moving the next file, if a file by that name  already 
exits, you may choose how to proceed. The different choices are:

[Y]       Overwrite duplicate. The old file will be overwritten.

[T]       Time up duplicate (update file). The dates of both files  will 
          be  compared, and if the file you wish to copy is more  recent 
          than the other, the copy will be made. 

[C]       Change name duplicate. Copy the file, but change its name.  If 
          this  new name exists too, you'll find yourself back  in  this 
          menu.

[N]       No duplicate. Don't copy the file (pressing [ESC] has the same 
          effect).

If  you  press [SHIFT] when choosing on of these options, the  scope  of 
this choice is extended to cover all subsequent duplicate filenames.


* MACRO commands which can be used with the [X] or [R] command *

After an [X] or [R] command, the following MACRO's may be used:


     $C   Name of the file at the cursor position (WITH extent).
     $X   Name of the file at the cursor position (WITHOUT extent).
     $D   Name of the current drive.
     $d   Name of the temporary drive.
     $J   Execute in the KANJI mode.
     $P   Insert the path of the current directory.
     $R   Insert a newline
     $O   Start an child program (put this at the start of a line).
     $T   Execute a series of tagged files (WITH extent).
     $t   Execute a series of tagged files (WITHOUT extent).
     $M   Collect  all  tagged  files  (WITH extent)  on  a  line,  then 
          execute.
     $m   Collect  all  tagged files (WITHOUT extent) on  a  line,  then 
          execute.
     $$   To use the '$' character.


     * About WILDCARD names *

For  use in wildcard names, MM has an additional special  character,  in 
addition  to  the  usual '?' and '*'. This is the  '/'  character.  This 
permits  us to display or select all filenames which contain the  string 
following this character.

For instance:  /COM      (the '/' must be at the start of the line)

Files, which match this name, would be:

COMMAND2.BAK    MM.COM          PMMCOM.DOC      &c.
^^^                ^^^             ^^^

The  '/'  and '*' characters may not be used together. Use one  or  more 
'?' characters instead.


     * About referring to directories *

With  MM, just like in MSX-DOS 2, you can use use '.', or even  '..'  to 
refer to directories (except from within the root directory).

For  instance, if you decompress using '.', the decompressed files  will 
be stored on the current drive and in the current directory. 

Referring  to  a  directory  using  '.'  is  possible  for  setting  the 
decompression directory, or the root.

'.' = the current directory and '..' is the parent directory.


     * About the screensaver *

If no key is pressed for a certain time (by default about three minutes) 
a  screensaver program will be loaded. This time may be modified  during 
configuration.


     * About configuring MM *

CS.COM is a utility program to modify the settings used by MM, and  also 
which  external  programs, brought together by the user, will  be  used. 
So, to configure MM.COM, use CS.COM.

Method:
Make  sure  sure MM.COM, MM.TBL and MM.CFG are present  in  the  current 
directory, and CS.COM must also be somewhere on disk. Now type: 

     CS MM

(If CS.COM doesn't start, specify a full pathname for it.)

Subsequently, the settings are automatically set from the  configuration 
file MM.CFG. You'll need some free space on disk for this to work.  Read 
MM.CFG for more details on possible configurations.


     * Remarks *

MM cannot deal with more than 255 files at a time. Any excess files will 
be ignored.

If  you use the ViewROM (a font-cartridge sold with MSX-VIEW) or even  a 
FS-A1GT,  you can use 12x8 characters.

The TPA will NOT be any smaller when executing a file from within MM.

For  that  reason, BAT-files which start a child program,  if  they  are 
invoked by [SHIFT]+[X] or [R], may not necessarily return to MM.

After  sorting  a  directory, it isn't possible yet to  write  back  the 
result.

MM does not have a function to execute a series of commands, in order to 
avoid making the TPA smaller.


     * conditions of use & warnings *

MM is freeware. MOGU, its author, retains all copyrights.

Copying is possible. The procedure is outlined above.

I  cannot  be held responsible for any accidents or  damages  caused  by 
using MM.
 
If there are any BUGs, please send me a list of them. I will fix them in 
the next version.

<Heavy bullshit omitted - the translator>

I still think of MM as a work in progress. So, if you've discovered  any 
bugs, or have any wishes, please write to me. m(_)m
