
The WOEI demo...
Team Bomba has gone crazy again! Instead of finishing Bombaman we've come up with some other silly idea (thanks to the MRC forums): The WOEI demo! Just run the demo to see why we're really doing this :)


System requirements...
The WOEI demo runs on MSX2 and higher, at least 128KB RAM/VRAM needed. Oh yeah, don't forget to connect a MoonSound, or else you won't hear the music...


What did we use to create The WOEI demo...
-PC (P3@450Mhz, more crap in it..)
-NMS8250 with MoonSound
-GEN80 (on PC using CP/M emulation)
-Context (texteditor)
-Bitbuster (to compress files)
-AGE (pixel editing)
-XVI32 (hex editor)
-Chaos Assembler (just to rip the palettes :P)
-DskExplorer (to create and manage .dsk files)


Sourcecode...
We've included the sourcecode of this demo as well! If you're interested in doing VDP tricks, maybe you'll be able to find out new tricks (ok, maybe not...). Also, there's lots of general purpose code for managing library files, memory mapper, r800, basic VDP stuff. You may use all code freely, as long as you mention that parts of your work are (c) Team Bomba
