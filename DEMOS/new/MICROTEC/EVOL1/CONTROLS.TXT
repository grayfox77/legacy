E3D vers. 0.91


Requires:
MSX TurboR in R800-DOS2 mode.


How to start:
type MAIN at command prompt.
As in the previous version you will be asked to select:
1) VDP frequency (1 = 50Hz, 2 = 60Hz)
2) tkInterval: consider that required fps will be the result of
(VDPFrequency (50 or 60) / tkInterval) so if you choose
VDPFrequency = 60 and tkInterval = 4 (recommended) will will get (theorically) 15 fps.
3) MoonBlaster (MB for short) enable (0 = no MB, else MB will be loaded and
0.MBM/0.MBK will be played)


Additional features/changes:
- added "hunter ship" which turns toward your ship and follows you
- optimized clearing tecnique: clears only drawn areas
- use 192 vertical lines instead of 212 (to speed up)
- possibility to toggle between action/radar display
- object clip + raster routine moved to E3D2 (dynamic library)
- optimizations


Keys available:
- cursor keys: ship orientation
- ctrl: thrust forward
- shift: thrust backward
- space: fire a "straightforward energy ball" (SEB)
- X/x: create wireframe/flat eXplorer alien-ship
- W/w: create wireframe/flat Wafer alien-ship
- H/h: create wireframe/flat hunter alien-ship
- return to toggle camera between
  - follows SHIP at fixed distance
  - fixed
  - inside ship (the best to get target hit)
  - over the ship (BOSCONIAN style)
- F1: action mode
- F2 radar mode
  while in radar mode:
  - 1,3: rotate radar left and right
  - 2,5: rotate radar up and down
- esc to exit

Up to 6 other alien ships can be added (more ships = more cpu load = slower)
WARNING: if adding alien ships hangs MSX then SP has overlapped heap: to be fixed

Known bugs/enhancements-to-do:
- stars do not respect z-depth
- SEB orientation is sometimes not precise
- when camera is inside SHIP a sort of view-finder could be useful
