
After a short leave of 10 years the
Lieves!Tuore posse is back with:

ATSAAS

Originally released at MSX Info
Update'08 in Helsinki. Ended up 2nd
in the demo compo, as usual. In the
different directories you'll find a
.dsk for emulators, the real deal
plus the full source.

ATSAAS.COM is the better version for
real MSX1 computers, on MSX2 run
ATSAAS2.COM. A bit crippled but works
correctly.

Marq - main code
Yzi - music, sound code, add. code
Man - gfx
