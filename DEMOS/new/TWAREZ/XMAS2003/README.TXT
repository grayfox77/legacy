Howdy folks, we're back, just for once!

As always we try to amaze you once more
with a fine piece of software made for
an MSX2 or higher with at least 128K
RAM and VRAM and an MSX-AUDIO plugged
in to one of your slots (whether we do 
amaze you is up to you, probably not).
Okay, still, we want you to enjoy the
stupidness of TWZ humor, since we
haven't changed a bit since Tunez II!

So come on, stick that big phat 
philips audio music thing in one of them
big MSX sluts (ehm, slots) and boot this
piece of refreshing bits!

The TWZ cru!


The instructions:

The demo is shipped on a disk image. This
image uses a file system completely 
different than FATxx, which is normally
used to store files on disk. We call this
Fat.tw.set 3. This means normally you can't
run this demo from HD or flashcard or
something like that... This is not true.
The image is shipped with a file called
start.com. Use this in MSX-DOS(2) with
the image as parameter and the disk will
be booting!
When you want to copy the image to a 
real dd-diskette then extract the package
and use the CopyToA.bat batch file which
will copy the disk to the A drive. Be
sure a DD-disk is in the drive! That's all!



The demo's:
Logo intro	- TeddyWareZ logo with c00l 
		  sinus effect (does not work
		  on NlMSX, works on OpenMSX)

Loading intro	- Now you've got something to 
		  watch when the data gets
		  read into memory!

The real intro	- Really cool movie effect
		  intro with loads of humor!

Snowfall demo	- The actual snowfall demo with
		  falling snow that stays put
		  and a superb text in the scroller!

Extra demo	- A superb BONUS scroller with MANY
		  COOL effects, maybe the coolest
		  scroller of TwZ ever! (this could
		  be an entry for the logo and 
		  scroller challenge) :P
