Unreleased demo by Maggoo of IOD/Abyss
--------------------------------------

Designed to be part of the megademo Metal Limit but
never included due to it's bad design and because of the
lack of time to finish it.

Some interesting effects however : 

* Palette rasters on 4 colors (3 on TR) on the top part of the screen.
  Precalc program for the bar movements included also on the disk.
* Scroll text of 64*64 fonts using set adjust registers and page flipping.
  The scrolltext is then stretched to 128 pixels high and fonts are 
  tortured with a funky color cycling.
  Background color raster have been added in the background 'cow it was possible :)
  
Music use the standard moonblaster replayer routine. As far as I remember,
the tune was only working with MSX Audio, sorry.
 
Source code might be re-used, copied or modified by anyone. 

Keep MSXing !
