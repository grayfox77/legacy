
A quick MSX port of the Vammala
Party'12 winner, SR-200. Originally
made for Panasonic JR-200. See the
original readme below.

(The) Fiture "Crew" presents at
Vammala Party'12:

SR-200

Code: Marq
Tune: Yzi

A little proof-of-concept with big
smooth scrolling and music for
Panasonic JR-200UP. Play back the wav
file to the cassette port and enjoy.
Will not work with emulators because
of the timings and the use of
undocumented features (oh well,
there's no documentation available
anyway).

There is no VBI or retrace register on
the JR-200, but some hacking let 
us sync to the screen refresh. For
more information on the method see 
the source and the page below.
