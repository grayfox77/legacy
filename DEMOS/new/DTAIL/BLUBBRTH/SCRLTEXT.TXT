                [D-TAIL] IS PROUD TO PRESENT TO YOU...        "BLUB 'N' BREATHE"        IT'S A KIND OF MARIO CLONE, ENTIRELY MADE IN BASIC, USING NESTORBASIC. YOU MIGHT BE BORED A BIT, BECAUSE THERE IS NO MUSIC. WELL, THE TRUTH IS, I'M NO MUSICIAN. SO THAT'S NO MUSIC FOR YOU THIS TIME. SORRY!        PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY A PARTIAL MRC UNDERWATER CHALLENGE PROJECT. I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO FINISH IT PROPERLY. AS YOU CAN SEE, MY PROGRESS WAS QUITE FAR. I MADE IT ALL IN ONE AND A HALF WEEK. BEFORE, I WAS BUSY STUDYING. AFTER ONE AND A HALF WEEK OF WORKING, I REALIZED I COULDN'T MANAGE TO FINISH IT, SO I ABANDONED IT. THAT'S ALSO PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF EXAMS WHICH I HAD TODAY (AND TOMORROW... STRANGE TO SAY THIS, I'M TYPE-WRITING THIS ON THURSDAY THE 13TH OF MAY, 2004 :D). DUE TO THAT HEAVY WEEK FULL OF EXAMS, I DIDN'T MANAGE TO PUT ENOUGH TIME INTO THIS PROJECT. I'M VERY SORRY... NEVERTHELESS, I INCLUDED THE GAME'S SOURCE (THIS PART OF THE ENTRY, THE MULTILAYERED SCROLLS, CAN BE CONSIDERED FINISHED, SINCE IT WORKS PROPERLY). YOU CAN OPEN THE GAME'S SOURCE (GAME.ASC) INTO ANY TEXT EDITOR, BUT PREFERABLY COMPASS. IT WAS MADE IN COMPASS AS WELL, AND I MUST SAY IT HAS SOME NEAT FEATURES CONCERNING AUTO-TABBING...    ---    LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE NOW, FOR EXAMPLE WHAT I TRIED TO ACHIEVE BY THIS DEMO/GAME. I TRIED TO MAKE A MARIO CLONE IN BASIC, FOR MSX2+ AND MSX TURBO R. ALAS, I DIDN'T MANAGE TO MAKE IT FOR MSX2+ EITHER. IT CAN RUN ON A MSX2+, BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR MSX RUNS IN 60HZ MODE, YOU'LL EXPERIENCE A LOT OF SCREEN BLITTERING... :( ... WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S NOTHING THAT COULDN'T BE DONE ON A GENUINE MSX2+. BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT FREAKING LIMIT OF THE BASIC INTERPRETER. EVEN WITH NESTORBASIC, THERE'S A LOT OF OVERHEAD. NOW, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET, YOU CAN BASH SPACE TO LET THE MAIN MENU POP UP. THIS SCROLLY WILL CONTINUE, DON'T WORRY ;)...        <CREDITS> --> CODE (FOR AS FAR AS IT IS FINISHED): [D-TAIL] --> GFX: [D-TAIL] --> AND THAT'S THAT, I THINK :D...        ACTUALLY, I'M SURPRISED WHAT BASIC'S CAPABLE OF: WHEN YOU RUN THIS ON A TURBO R MACHINE, YOU WILL HAVE 4 LAYERS SCROLLING. THAT'S THE OCEAN'S WAVES NEAR THE HORIZON, THIS TEXT SCROLLY, AND THE WAVES IN THE FOREGROUND. ALSO, THE MENU IS A DIFFERENT LAYER :D. ON A MSX2+ HOWEVER, BASIC DOESN'T MANAGE THE WAVES IN THE FOREGROUND, SO I LET THEM ROLL ALONG WITH THOSE IN THE HORIZON...        ANYWAY, ANYHOW... THIS IS HOW IT WORKS: PRESS THE CURSOR KEYS TO GO THROUGH THE MENU OR TO MOVE OUR MARIO BOY. PRESS [ESC] ANYTIME TO LEAVE TO BASIC. USING SPACE YOU WILL SELECT THE OPTION IN THE MENU, OR JUMP IN THE GAME. NOTE THAT THE BACKGROUND COLLISION ISN'T WORKING, AND YOU'LL RUN OUT OF OXYGEN VERY FAST...        NAH... NOTHING ABOUT IT... I ALSO INCLUDED THE MAP EDITING TOOL ON DISK. PRESS [ESC] TO GO TO BASIC, THEN SAY RUN"BUILDER4.BAS". IT REQUIRES A MOUSE CONNECTED IN PORT ONE. BE CAREFUL THOUGH... YOU'LL OVERWRITE THE IN-GAME MAP. CHECK THE LISTING TO MODIFY CERTAIN THINGS, LIKE FILENAMES. YOU'LL SAVE THE MAP BY PRESSING [CTRL]+[S]. YOU'LL ESCAPE WITHOUT SAVING USING [ESC]. WITH THE CURSOR KEYS, YOU CAN SCROLL ALONG THE MAP. PRESSING LEFT MOUSE BUTTON IN FIRST INSTANCE WILL DROP THE SELECTED PATTERN ON THE POSITION WHICH THE MOUSE IS OVER. PRESSING RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON WILL TOGGLE SCREENS, SO THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SELECT A PATTERN (USING LMB). PRESSING RMB THEN WILL CAUSE TO ANY FURTHER DRAWING ACTION TO BE DONE WITH THAT SPECIFIC PATTERN.        AS SAID, I ALSO INCLUDED THE GAME'S SOURCE ON DISK. I'M NOT PLANNING TO FINISH THIS GAME ANYWAY. LACK OF TIME YOU KNOW. BUT IF ANYONE IS WILLING TO FINISH IT, I'LL LET YOU. LOAD THE SOURCE IN A TEXT EDITOR, AND OFF YOU GO! I'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR SUPPORT THOUGH. IF YOU'VE ANY QUESTION ABOUT THE GAME'S SOURCE, HOW TO MODIFY IT, I STILL HAVE IT, SO YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT. CONTACT ME EITHER BY THE MRC FORUM, OR BY E-MAIL. MY E-MAIL ADDRESS IS (PRESS 'PAUSE' TO HALT THIS TEXT :D): A.F.M.VANHERK@STUDENT.UTWENTE.NL  ---  SO THAT IS: A.F.M.VANHERK@STUDENT.UTWENTE.NL. HAPPY MSXING, I'LL CONTINUE DEVELOPING, SO NO WORRIES... :D                THIS TEXT WILL WRAP....................................
