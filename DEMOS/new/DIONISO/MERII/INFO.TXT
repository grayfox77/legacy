-MERII KURISUMASU-

Little MSX 1 demo called Merry Christmas in Japanese - though it could have
been called Happy New Year since it's 4th of January already.

Tested to work in MSX 1 computers; screen 1, PSG music, 50 hz.

Coded in assembler with COMPASS, but in a Turbo-r ST for speed in assembling
the code.

Happy new year, and enjoy your MSX.
