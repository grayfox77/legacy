MSX 20 years Anniversary demo
-----------------------------

Released 06/2003 by Maggoo of Abyss.

Launch with "start.bat"

This demo should work on every MSX 2/2+ and TurboR
with 512KB Mapper. It works well with OpenMSX 0.3.1. 
Some parts in screen 3 seems to cause problems with NL-MSX 0.43. 
No particular music card required as only PSG is supported. 
The demo is DOS1 and DOS2 compatible (for installation on HD).

The complete ASM source code should be available online
in the course of this month.

Many thanks to Snout of the MRC team for his help with 
beta testing the demo on real machines and thanks to Marq 
of Lieves!Tuore for his help with the MYM file format.
