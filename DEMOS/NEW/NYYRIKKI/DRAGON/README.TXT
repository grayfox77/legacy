                         Made By : NYYRIKKI 2006

Updated: 5.5.2006

Minimum system requirements:
 - MSX2 with 64KB VRAM
 - MSX-DOS2
 - IDE Hard drive, CD-ROM or Compact flash card


Please note:

Folowing commandline options can be used to select sound device:

 /A -> Force MSX-AUDIO
 /M -> Force MSX-Music *
 /C -> Force Covox
 /P -> Force Philips Music-Module

* This is early version and MSX-Music support is experimental. If you don't
hear anything (or almost anything), try to execute CALL MUSIC from BASIC
first. MSX-Audio is strongly recommended to be used instead when possible.

If you have problems with picture, try to copy the datafile next to original.
Unfortunately this version does not handle file fragmentation correctly.
