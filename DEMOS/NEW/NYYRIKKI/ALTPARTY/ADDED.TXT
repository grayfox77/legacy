This demo was made for Alternative party, that was held in Finland on
easter -98.

There was plenty of different computers and a demo competition, and
this demo was made to show, that MSX1 was not only MSX, that was made...
All changes, that I have done after competition are made only because of
compatibility reasons. Outlook is not changed. (This demo took 5:th place)

FAQ: Why there is so mutch Finnish flags ?
A:   Finland is now 80 years old, and this demo was released on easter,
     so why not ?

FAQ: Why this demo loads so f****** often ?
A:   This demo was showed from HD, so it was better to load small parts
     all the time, than have few huge loading breaks. If you have HD, then
     it is more, than recommended to copy this demo first to HD and then
     run it.
