
	'Planet of the epas' by Traktor

	Demo for MSX1 with at least 32 Kb ram.
	In binary form, so you will have to load it
	from tape to run it; with 'Bload "demo",r'.
	There's an mp3 enclosed in the archive, 
	record it unto tape or play it straight into
	your msx and you're ready to roll. A bit
	awkward maybe, but we don't have a diskdrive.

	Credits: bore and esau - code
		 esau - music and gfx

	This demo is coded entirely in Cygnus Ed
	on Amiga, cross-assembled with Cazm 1.27
	and transfered to a Yamaha CX5M using our
	own transfer util. No emulators used.

	Regarding emulation:
	PLEASE don't! If you haven't got the stuff
	or patience to watch it on proper hardware
	watch the video! Fool-proof solution.
	And this goes for ALL productions, not just
	this demo: If there's a proper video-capture
	out there, watch the vid and stay away from
	the emulator. Thank You!

	Greetings Nature Tulou Elcrew Scarab Uprough
	Nukleus Phantasy Craze La Paz and everyone if
	anyone keeping the msx scene alive.
