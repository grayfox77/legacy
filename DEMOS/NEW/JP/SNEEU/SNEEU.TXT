a Snow Demo by JP Grobler 2003

I know the scroll is shaky but it is my first real msx demo.
I had no clue as to the VDP before this. Now I am confused!

Copy all the files in one place.
Run "sneeu.bas"

Enjoy

'sneeu' is the afrikaans word for 'snow', close to the dutch 'sneeuw'?


msx2 needed!

Routines used:
* random generator - Bifi
* calc of new x & y - Bifi, modified
* snow table - 3 bytes x,y,old colour to redo the background
* scroller - MAGGOO scroll demo, modified to allow for snow falling

Font - my own, in paintshop v7
Pset / Reset / Point - my own (bugger if you try them on RuMsx)

Jokes - internet
picture - my own drawing, saw a similar one once

Thanks for all putting up sources, Hans Ottens site, msx.org etc
