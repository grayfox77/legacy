When cleaning up archives I found this old disk that I used to store
work-in- progress. This disk contains some testing routines of me when
I was developing the game 'SandStone'

The routines on this disk are incomplete! They are functional but
minor cleanups still needed to be done and they WILL lock-up your
computer on exit!

Since I lack the time to properly redo parts of the code and make a
nice demo out of it, I decided to release this disk as-is, since the
routines are a nice proof of concept of enhanced 3D on a regular MSX2
or higher. All things are real-time calculated using highly optimized
routines and data-structures. No tricks are used!

You can start them by using the following bat files:

l.bat -> starts the hidden 3d part of sandstone
h2.bat -> starts the Hi score entry routine
