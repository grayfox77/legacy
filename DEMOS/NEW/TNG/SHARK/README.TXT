SHARK

This is my entry for the 'MRC UnderWater challenge'
It was supposed to be an updated version of an old arcade
game called 'blue shark'. I spend so much time creating a
fancy intro-screen that I wasn't able to complete the game
itself :-(

I will put this project to rest for a few weeks, I do
however want to complete this game later on. If somebody is
intrested in the sources, just contact me at dhran@pi.be
Also if somebody wants to contributed music... 

Things that have to be finished before this game is
completed.
- Correcting the game cursor and fine-tune its speed
- Build the collision detection for the harpoon
- Display number of gained points for a few seconds if a
  game object is shot.
- Build a score counter
- Create a Highscore counter
- Initials entry screen for people who get a high score
- A top-ten players list (with their respective score)
- Create a wave animation to be placed upon the top of the
  'sea'
- Some extra animations like boats and submarines
- Have the diver displayed only if there are 500 or more
  points to be lost
- Have the random routine check to make sure that there
  aren't too much sprites on a line
- Create some extra palletes, like one for sunset, sunrise,
  night, and have the sea pallette slightly change during
  the game
