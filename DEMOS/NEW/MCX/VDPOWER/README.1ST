                                     El Belloto, November 27th 1994
                                     
 Hi there!                         
 
        this is a simple preview of the demo called VDPOWER,
        which will be released probably next year (1995).
        the original idea was born due to we didn't know demos
        on the MSX-world, but this year (beginning of 1994)
        i known about the existence of lots of groups working
        and enjoying with this kind of programs...
        
 requeriments:
 	
        to run the preview, you'll need at least a MSX2 computer,
        with 64Kb and standard MEMORY MAPPER and 128KB VRAM,
        so the japanases guys also will be able to see it...
         
 observations:
 	
       - this preview don't have sound. the music routine and musics
        are being developed by Human Byte of 5to sector at Belloto sur
        (South Belloto if you want to search it in a map)
       
       - the I/O access to VDP is made trought the 98h, 99h, 9ah and 9bh
        ports to reach more speed.
        
       - maybe some routines have hidden bugs that I still don't know,
        although it works perfectly on my TALENT TPC-310 MSX2 128KB.
        so any problem, please contact me if you can.
         
       - this preview don't contain the most amazing FX's, just the 
       first that i made.
       
       - the android picture was taken from ALESTE SPECIAL by COMPILE,
       so here goes the greetings:    greetings to COMPILE  :)
       
       - after the android's zoom is the multicolour effect that
       was made using the VDP registers 20, 21 and 22. this FX 
       isn't visible in a B/W TV or a monochromatic monitor.

       
FXs already finished that will be released with VDPOWER in the future:


       -smooth fullscreen 360 degree rotation!!!!
       -smooth pictures's zooms (even with rotations, etc).
       -huge scrolltext with an animation in the background.
       -flying over a points's field with montains.
       -the Cook, dedicated to Human Byte.
       -the greetings will be showed in a vertical scroll with
        3 stars planes in the background.
       
FXs that are being developed in time:

       -FractalZoom!
       -vectors objects
      
      
      
      I hope the demo can be finished this summer and you like this
      preview of it.
