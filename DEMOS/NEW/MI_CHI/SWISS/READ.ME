Hi Freaks!!!

You are now the happy owner of this freeware pruduct, that means you may copy
this demo as much as you like but you may NOT sell it. If you got it from any
Public Domain dealer then demand back ya money!!!

We hope we have been able to give a little view of the wide range of the
possibilities of the MSX turbo R, that means in the usage of the given hard-
functions like the scrolling in all directions, the sound and especially the
realtime calculation of 3D animations even with filled graphic and hidden line
objects.

Some information about this demo:
Period of making: 4 Months (with very long interrupts because of the distance
                  between the programmer and the graphicians...)
Unpacked length : 976 Kbytes
Packing method  : Byte-Sequences & Compressing (by Huffmann - therefore the
                  depacking is not very fast)
Programming     : XBasic (I was lazy again...), Basic and Assembler
                  next time maybe completely in Assembler...
Music           : MuSICA (FM + PSG + SCC (only the Snatcher or SD-Snatcher one)
Memory          : 96K - but this is only available in turbo-mode with >=256KB
Programmed in   : Switzerland & Germany
Circumstances   : very bad & time-pressure
Original        : on a 2DD-TDK disk in Tilburg with a nice label and for Fl.10

More info, if you haven't discovered it yet:
- the hidden-line routine is still not perfect
- the slow speed of the filled 3D graphics is because of the slow V-chip
- there's a hidden music player and a small surprise for F..... K...... fans,
  but read the scrolls!!!
- the 3D-demo (with the filled hidden line objects) can be involved when
  pressing the left of the right mousebutton. The objects disappear after
  exactly 1 minute (if you always push SPACE, you will not see the other
  objects!!!)
- normally you can get out or skip parts of the demo when pressing SPACE
