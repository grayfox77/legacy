DOPEFISH


.name:		The Darkness God Of Destroy DopeFish

.system:	MSX2 + Moonsound

.credz:		everything (c) 2k4 BodyHammeR
		except: musicdriver (c) someone else ;)

.about:		This silly screen is all that remains of the cool idea I had
		to make a wild intro with the DopeFish and send it in as an
		entry for the MSX Resource Center Underwater Challenge.

		Too bad, this is all that's left! The good part is you won't
		be bored to death by all that watery stuff ;).

		Once again: 'this screen does not check for hardware, so be
		sure to meet the system requirements before running.

		Don't worry: the musics' supposed to sound like that ;).
		Remember: It's D-O-P-E-fish!!!

.mk3:		No known bugs, unlike that game from Acclaim...

.dopefish:	Ooh, those silly people at Apogee...
