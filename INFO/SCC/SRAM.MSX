Looking at MGLOAD.COM I've seen that it uses 5000h too...>why??  And 7FFEh, writting 10h to eneable the write on SRAM?>  I've looked the manual, but nowhere it speaks about 5000h and 7FFEh :-?>Can you explain me how to write?>I developped some hardwares. (ESE-RAM disk,ESE-SCC disk,MEGA-SCSI,WAVE-SCSI)You can use MGLOAD.COM for theese 'ESE-series' hardwares.ESE-RAM and MEGA-SCSI uses 6000,6800,7000,7800h.ESE-SCC and WAVE-SCSI uses 5000,7000,9000,B000,7FFEh.When you write to SRAM in MEGA-SCSI, set (banknumber+80h) to bank resister.(example : ld a,0 / or 80h / ld (6000h),a / ld a,'A' / ld (4000h),a)>2) What's "SPC"?It means SCSI Protcol Controller MB89352A.>3) I'd like you translate section 10.2 (BANK MAP) from the manual for me,>please ;)  (or better, all the Section 10 :)bank 0 to 3fh are used for ROM area. you can write through bank 80h to BFhMEGA-SCSI kernel is on bank 0 to 7.bank 7Fh is used for SPC port.(On SPC bank(7Fh), 4000-4FFFh : Data resister, 5FF0-5FFEh : SPC resisters.)bank 80h to BFh are used for reading/writing bank 0 to 3Fh.bank C0h to FFh are used for reading/writing.(bank 80h to 87h are used as MEGA-SCSI kernel.)(bank 88h to FFh are used as ESE-RAM disk data area.)>4) On the disk you sent me with the cartridge, there was something about>SCC. What's that?  I'm interested on how to connect a Konami SCC cartridge>without the game runs, but having access to the SCC...ESE-SCC is a RAM disk cartridge with SCC.To make, you have to make it from KONAMI-SCC game.You can load KONAMI game data to ESE-SCC with MGLOAD.COM.summary...ESE-RAM   : ramdiskESE-SCC   : ramdisk + SCCMEGA-SCSI : ramdisk + SCSIWAVE-SCSI : ramdisk + SCSI + SCCAny WAVE-SCSI information is not prevailed. I've not written document.Only MEGA-SCSI is for sale. Other hardwares are for self making.Bye, Tsujikawa Kazuhiro.
