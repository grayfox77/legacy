 Hello, all the Ese-hardware nerds worldwide. Recently Ese-RAM users are showing more and more increase, Ese populations are rising daily. MEGA SCSIs and their ordering conditions are settled, thus quite a lot of users are there I assume.

 However I have no clear idea how many Ese-SCC users are there in fact. I want to increase my Ese-SCC friends. This diary-like thing is a reading matter based on my true experience of Ese-SCC making. I tried to make this as easy to read as possible, but I suppose there are a lot of items I forgot and not aware of. I really pray that even a stuff like this might prove some help to you.

 This diary assumes that the reader has experience in making Ese-RAMs. However, this (maybe of which I hope so that it) tells you the very feeling of actual work process, so even if you had no experience before, read as you like. However, hardware nerds with more than intermediate skill may yawn at this (^^;


 However, if this interests YOU the beginner...
                 That's a gate to Ese-hardware nerds...(laughter

 Today I went to Akihabara to make an Ese-SCC. Compared to Ese-RAMs, I could tell it's really difficult only by looking at Tsujikawa-san's document. But I'm not allowed to fuss that way.

 I already made up my mind to start directly with 512KB, so number of 628128 I acquired was 4. HC139 I used in time of Ese-RAM is now double, also I gonna use HC74 and HC133.
 These totaled to 3500 yen now.

 Problem is, a "gold capacitor". Small ones with 1.0F size are not easily found. Several shops say "this one." and pass you yellow-greenish thick one. Some of them pass you ones with 4 to 5 cm of diameters. The smallest one I know is from NEC with blue coating. Be careful, or you will cry later forced to modify the case (this blue one usually require no case adjustment).

 ..It was in a shop with the name I forgot, which was in one of radio stores and number (5) written on its placard. It was a shop which vends resistors and similar items. 2 blue capacitors are placed in center of the shop stall, nearly falling out, placed inside a case. When I asked the owner of the shop, he replied "yeah, there are numberless stocks".

 Suspicious... there are extra amount in the storage. He said you need prior assignment to buy more than 10 (?). I asked the price, which was 630 yen a piece. I got 3 on the spot, easily acquired other parts (lines, resistors and diodes) and went back home.

 I came home, and immediately began works trying to remove the ROM. Solder sucker wasn't working well, so I preferred solder suction line. You should be quite used to solder suction lines to employ it. You should melt the soldering, and immediately heat the suction line itself, and place it to the surface with solder on for a while. If you leave it touched too long, it will peel off circuit patterns, so be careful. Now, I'll get used to it slowly.



 Hunger came on me so I had a late dinner. Then my friend visited me, and when I got back to myself it was already 3 o'clock in the morning. That's all for today. Rest will be for tomorrow.

[628128]
	　This is called SRAM (Static RAM), a RAM which can preserve it own contents using feeble electrical current. It's more expensive than normal RAMs, because, suppose 1 transistor is necessary for a normal RAM, SRAM need 4 of them, therefore this difference come to be reflected in price. 628128 has 128KB capacity, so making an Ese-SCC naturally require 4. There is a stuff called 628512 with 4 times the capacity. (This is really expensive. Once you kill it by mistake you'll cry (;_;). Recommended if you have enough courage or dexterity)

[Gold Capacitor]
	　A condenser. 1.0F noted in the article is referring to its capacity.
	Here it is used to backup an SRAM. Bigger the capacity, longer it endures. If you are going to use Ese-SCC frequently, small capacity ones are OK.

	In essence, if you use a gold capacitor, Ese-RAM becomes rechargeable type.
	(Even 0.37F class of capacity can endure 1 month *Tested by my own standard *)

 2nd day. A day to tidy up a wiring diagram. I checked a 256KB version wiring diagram again and copied it onto a paper.
 Mumbling "this line fits here...", I made pin-to-pin correspondence and wiring diagram. After that I checked the alteration implying with 512KB version and added them to the wiring diagram. Mmmm, now sources are ready.

 I gazed over these sources, and tidied my head thinking in what order I gonna wire. I knew there are two HC139s, so I work out which one is which firstly... The HC139 which should be regarded more in 512KB version is the one which selects the chip by input from address line, and output to various /CSs  of 628128.
(Numbering them might be a good idea).

 In Ese-SCC, once you cut the circuit you cut the power source patters, but by fully obeying Tsujikawa-san's instructions, wiring returns the power again so rest assured. Cutting with a wire saw is good, but I happened to be without one, so I cut down the unnecessary circuit area forcibly using a "piano cord cutter" which I had on my side. (You should not imitate me) Before anything I should connect the power lines securely. Next is mega-con, then between 74HC series chips, and at last the address lines and SRAM backup capacitors.

 Before I sleep, let's check the parts again. I made my whole plans while doing that, and left actual works to tomorrow's.
					.
					.
					.


 But I cannot sleep. Circuit diagram really occupies my head. In such times, I'll do some game, make me real tired then sleep. All the time drinking a coffee or two (no I shouldn't go that way)



>> My Personal Lecture on Terms 2 <<

[Mega-con]
	　Abbreviation for MegaROM controllers. One should be in any of megaROM games. (^^:

[74HC Series]
	　74HC series have many other colleagues (families) other than HC74, HC133 and HC139 referred here. They are all ICs which outputs to certain inputs.
	I do not know their small details, so if necessary search by yourself. 



>><<< Diary of On the Ocean, 3rd Day >>><<-----------------------------------------------


 Today is for actual wiring work. Let's use a little thicker (0.5 mm diameter) lines to wire to power lines. This is to stabilize execution. Thin lines caused no problems, but if you are going to make a MEGA-SCSI later, you better be careful using thick lines. I have heard of another stuff called knitted lines. I really want to use knitted lines to signal and like parts which fast execution is required. But, I heard this insists some amount of technique to work on, so I will wait until I'll work on a MEGA-SCSI.

 Mount an SRAM at first. Bearing alteration to 512KB version in my head, I cut the leg ends of pins except those which can be connected in original forms. If you mount them over another, since there are four 628128s, they basically would never fit inside casing. This can be solved by some modifications, but the more serious problem is that YOU CANNOT INSERT INTO MSX SLOT (oh my god!!).

 If you leave legs too long, they won't fit to be inserted into a slot, resulting in you to repeat again...
Do not get mad in such times. Such manner will really spoil you after all.
(From editor: Hey, this is supposed to be diary, isn't it?) I know a man who crushed his himself by this. At least you should be careful of yourself. Cut the legs as much as you can, and mount the first layer of SRAM with its lower belly almost having contact with the board.
(From editor: I mean, who are you speaking too?)

 Now, second layer this time. The troublesome things is, whether this will be correctly connected with RAM beneath. I should be really careful so that I will not cry later. I gonna apply a load of soldering (beware of the neighboring pins). Soldering while pressing down with a pincher or something is a good idea.

 Did I succeed to "float" the pins which should be kept "floated in air"? Are electrical conducts OK? 
					.
					.
					.

 Nextly, adhere 74HC series chips other than SRAM to back of the board. I used double-sided adhesive tape. Stabilize them securely, and think about the clearance to wire through.

 I could understand well where to revive the power source after I've cut the board, so I scraped off some part of +5V pattern, applied solder there to connect to HC139 (you should pay extra attention here). By jumper-connecting to other chips, power is connected. Jumper-connect GND accordingly, so now power line is ready at least. I check the conduction with a electrical tester.

 That's O.K.

 It won't hurt if I solder between the patterns on board and 74HC series chips being apart, so I do it.


 I am going out now : ). Say, say, let's prepare.



>> 私説用語解説　３ <<

[+5V&GND]
	　+5V is positive (plus). GND is negative (minus).

[Jumper-connect]
	 This means to bridge and connect (a pin) here and (a pin) there. In this case, plus should be connected with plus and minus should be connected with minus. This is obvious in Tsujikawa-san's images in his construction documents.


	

>><<< Diary on the Ocean, 4th day >>><<---------------------------------------------------


 4th day. Since I finished mounting 74HC series and RAM chips onto board, and wiring of power lines, so I have other wiring works left. Leave diode and capacitor for later.

 Rest of the wiring begin today. As a kickstart let's move on to line connection of mega-con and 74HC series, as I have decided prior to the work. Connect HC133 directly with a mega-con, then to HC74, HC133 and HC139 respectively. 
 I should wire in a way not to hinder the later wiring. If I do not, maybe the case will not close later! :(

 When it's done, next is line connection within 74HC. This is quite mini-scale part, so I should pay real care to solder while making sure not to melt the nearby lines, plucking with pincher-like instruments. Works around here is most tiring. I continued my work while being nearly turned white with exhaustion.

  1 to 7 pin of the HC139 for Ese-RAM, and 15 to 9 pins on end of HC139 located on end of a 628128 is correspondent to the chip I mentioned (one which a resistor is to be applied). SRAM chip selection is done here.

 In 512KB version, /RESET signal from mega-con is thrown out of a HC139. The thrown-out sgnal is then input into CS the No. 30 pin of each chips. The problem is who is in charge to throw out the signal. That's increased address signal. In case of an Ese-SCC, No. 40 pin (MA18) of the mega-con fits here.



 If you have reached here, completion is only a step away. Go solder smashing all the way after. If you have guts left, you can go through all the way. But mine is now empty, so I quit around here




>><<< Diary on the Ocean, 5th Day >>><<---------------------------------------------------


 Today, line connection of RAMs. If you have enough time, attach diode and capacitor to finish off. The remaining wiring are not much work (but perform cautiously). Line connections of each CS plug of 628128s to receive /RESET signals are already done. What's left are address-related ones and /CS.

 Firstly, connect each address lines with mega-con. In a Ese-SCC wiring diagram, order of address lines are somewhat swapped between RAM and megacon, but this poses no problem, so do not hesitate and connect exactly as the wiring diagram says.

 Now to the ramining /CS. Input to this decides what SRAM will be used. So, connect from any of the pins between No. 12 to 9 (order of selection is up to you) of HC139 to each correspondedt /CS (there are 4 of them). At this time, if you do not formally have HC139 (all No.9 to 12 pins) connected from +5V source via resistor, RAM execution will be unstable, so be careful. (This phenomenon is called Pull-up).

 Yes!! This is nearly all. After this, meticulously add diode and then to capacitor. Be noted that a plug with a marking is minus. Be extremely careful in polar tendency. This is a end to all the work sequence. Let's check then.

"And"... saying so, I insert the Ese-SCC into a slot without much caution. Oh, it's working. (skipping stern tests is not recommended in fact). Now work on the case! Mmmm, perfect! (it's finished before). I also gonna secure the capacitor with double-sided adhesive tape. Close the lid, then it's DONE!!

 Happy Ese-SCC 512KB life begins from today. (^^)/~~



	　　#**Now! You should challenge once!! **#




	　　~#* Summary of Alterations to 512KB version *#~



			~~ In case you use 628128~~


(from MA18 and 40 pins of mega-con => 2A and 14 pins of HC139), (from /RESET, 42 pins of mega-con => CS and 30 pins of each SRAMs)

Then connect securely 4 sets from 12 to 9 pins of HC139 which input to 30 pin /CS of SRAM.

			~~ In case you use 628512 ~~


 In case of 628512, which did not mention in this article.
Forget about the alteration items note above. (laughter)

 Since you need to use only one 628512.

 Simply connect MA17 of mega-con to No. 30 pin B5 (MA17) of the SRAM.
 Connect MA18 of mega-con to 2A, 14 pins of HC139, just like in 628128 x 4 time.
 (Also, beware that MA18 of mega-con is to be connected to B6 (MA18) of the SRAM!)
To connect from HC139 to /CS of SRAMの/CS, use only 2Y1 and 11 pins of HC139 and connect to /CS, 11pin of 628512. Else are common with 256KB version ^^;
(This will work fine I think)

*<< WRITER'S NOTES NOTE >>*


　Ese-ＳＣＣ512KB makes comfort. I am now challenging making a MEGA-SCSI, and I think using two together makes me to play around in various ways. I express my thanks again to Tsujikawa-san who provided us such a splendid environment to us MSX users.

 Maybe it's nice to plan your construction referring to this reading text after thoroughly reading Tsujikawa-san's resources. (though I am doubtful this works as a reference ^^;)

 However, beginning your first attempt with an Ese-SCC is, given that wiring is much more mini-scaled compared with Ese-RAMs and others and would prove very intangible, so I advise you to do after you had enough practice with Ese-RAMs. (Participating in Ese-RAM construction seminar is recommended to beginners. It's held once in 3 or 4 months. If anyone willing to participate want to know of the detail, as GIGAMIX, NGD, Mo Soft and similar organizations. You may directly write to me (who belongs to Front Line).)

 Using 628512 for SRAM is, (however expensive), works fine with fewer wiring amount. (A 628512 cost twice the case you use 628128s of same capacity... I mean, 7500 yen for 512KB (in present price)). Challenge with it after thinking fully about the difference with 628128 though, mind you :)

 As total, I took 5 days to make an Ese-SCC. Net time is approximately 24 hours. Second one took only about 6 hours to complete, which shows how important is to gain your experience. As Tsujikawa-san says, enjoy both hardware and software, keeping good balance between. Make our MSX really as ours, and make them live to 120% of its potential.


 For future of us and ourＭＳＸ.
