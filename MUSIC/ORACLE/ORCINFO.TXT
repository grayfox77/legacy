	O R A C L E v1.00 (release A)		 (c) Fuzzy Logic 1995-1997
       +------------------------------------------------------------------+

       Rock'n'Rol  with Fuzzy  Logic's magnificent music package ORACLE- a 
       terrific,  not-to-be-missed  utility from  the Dutch  company. It's 
       great value for money so low you can't even get drunk on!

       ORACLE  allows  you  to	compose your  own little  ditties usin'  a 
       variety of  sound samples and instruments. To get you started there 
       are  quite a  few included  on the  disk and they can be altered to 
       your heart's content by including different special effects.
       Any melody that you want to create can be done note by note using a 
       Step-Time-Editor. If you're a lucky, rather rich, MSX owner you can 
       even tap  out your tunes on your OPL4 in the near future! But let's 
       not  hastite with  un-coded programs and let us concentrate on this 
       particulair piece of jewelry!


       Some Info...
       ============
       At  first I  like to say that this is a BETA version that had to be 
       ready for  release on  the Tilburg  happening in 1997! So don't get 
       angry  if some option don't work (yet). In short time there will be 
       an update released which can be uploaded in any BBS or at Internet!

       This disk  contains all	the necessary  files to run your ORACLE on 
       your  (or other?) MSX computers. It is possible to print songs, but 
       we've only  included minor printing possibilities. If you make your 
       own  work-disk, remember to format that disk to the DOS 2.xx format 
       to  gain  more  advantages  concerning disk-routines!  (notice that 
       ORACLE is fully DOS 2 compatible!)

       This  version  will  probebly  be  full	of those  nasty bugs  that 
       encountered this planet... So, please contact us to correct all the 
       crummy gurus.


       The best configuration for ORACLE is:
       o A turbo R computer using the great R800
	 The Z80 version is a bit of a bummer coz' the replayer is using
	 many many effects and can replay atleast 32(!) channels at one
	 go!
       o Atleast 256 kRam of memory.
	 Each pattern will request a block of bytes anywhere in the RAM.
	 So, the more memory, the more patterns you can get! (max.256)
       o DOS 2.xx
	 No need telling this gives plenty advantages.
       o A Harddisk is very recomendable! (it always is...)

       My (shadow) config is:
       a Turbo R with 512 kRam, DOS 2.41 and an 80 meg. SCSI-Harddisk !


       How to get started:
       ===================
       We're sorry  that we  could not  include a  manual on paper in time 
       (this is the BETA version remember) so, we've putted all text files 
       at the on-board-help-desk. To reach the info files just press:

				  [graph] + [H]

       and  you'll be  at the  HELP desk! (tataa!). Here are several files 
       (including a  file for  KEYS) which will provide you with necessary 
       information.

       ORACLE  is a  new kind  of music editor and is a little simulair to 
       Moonblaster (the  structure of songs I mean) But the editor it self 
       takes  a lot  of time  and practise  to understand. Not that it's a 
       difficult program but it's just that Oracle is very NEW compared to 
       other programs  I could	mention. The  main functions are stored at 
       the  Pull-Down-Menus which  you can  acces by  pressing [graph]	in 
       combinatin with	the FAT-characters in the Topics at the top of the 
       screen.	(e.d [graph]+[F] for File menu [graph]+[I] for Instruments 
       etc.)


       Disk window:
       ============
       This  window deserves  special comments. At this window there are a 
       few keys to acces all files:
       [F1]	Set path (can include: Drive, Path and file/dirmask)
       [F2]	Set filename (can include: Drive and filename(+ext))
       [F3]	Select Filetype
       [F4]	Set Disk options

       To select a file you can either use the cursor keys or just type in 
       the name  of the  file and  ORACLE will	automaticly search for the 
       first file that is simulair to the "search" string. (this is a very 
       usefull option!!)
       

       Let me try to explain a common misunderstanding:
       ================================================
       "Look at  this man!  This new  tracker's got a really mind-crushin' 
       equalizer on board!"

       No it doesn't! In fact we have never seen a single MSX program with 
       an  equalizer.  But  VU-meters  (Volume Unit  that is)  or Spectrum 
       Analyzers are  featured on most demos and trackers! An equalizer is 
       just like a tone control with cut/boost controls for each frequency 
       range.  Just take a look at your stereo, and maybe you'll find some 
       sliders	marked	125,250,500  1k,  2k, 4k  etc. That  is a  Graphic 
       Equalizer.  There  are  also  Parametric Equalizers  where you  can 
       change the  center frequency  and Q-factor (bandwith) of each band, 
       but  they are  useally found on mixer consoles and other equipment. 
       Spectrum Analyzers show the relative volume of each frequency band, 
       but of  course the MSX cannot analyze the spectrum of an instrument 
       in  real  time,	so  it	will  just  show which	notes are  played. 
       VU-meters are even simpler, they show the volume of the sound or in 
       combination  with a  Note Analyzer  it shows each channel's volume. 
       But again, the MSX cannot show the real volume of the notes, so the 
       VU-meter just  pops up  to the volume you've set for that note, and 
       falls back to zero. Not even the Scopes will show the sound just as 
       it  is. They  just show	a few  bytes of  the sound,  and will just 
       "scroll" through the instrument as it plays.


       Things that you want, but we wont:
       ==================================
       o MIDI

       Look, guys;  ORACLE is  not supposed to be a MIDI sequencer, it's a 
       music  program that you use to create music for demos, games, music 
       disks or  what ever.  MIDI sequencers have got a much higher timing 
       resolution and lots of tracks (channels), while ORACLE has 16th and 
       only  up to  32 channels. Some of you want to hear you music played 
       on there (MIDI)keyboeards/synthesizers too, but the tracker was not 
       really designed	to do  that. The  MIDI functions  will have  to be 
       coded some day, but probebly it will only be used for the replay of 
       a song. In the mean time you can use some other music trackers...


       o Realtime record

       Oh no! Not that again. Haven't you learned yet? Recording/Editing a 
       song  REALTIME on  you wimpy  keyboards is as terrible as trying to 
       eat a banana while whistling the national-anthum!
       To be short NO WAY DUDE!


       Bugs we know of:
       ================
       Yes indeed there are a few bugs left that I could not found in time 
       in order to release this version, so look out for the update!

       o The Z80 mode is fucking slow!
	 Well...buy a R800 or 7.14 Meg or something

       o The sampler is a bit of a bummer when it comes to recording.
	 Yes this is not so bad as it sounds. The recording will be 100%
	 but while recording a lot of noize is produced. Notice that the
	 real sample will not include this rustle!

       o When a song is replayed some menus will give some trouble.
	 For example: if yer going to the "intrument list" while replaying
	 the instrument OPLL data will be re-set so it sounds a bit strange
	 but it can also be of use to test if a certain instrument will
	 perform as you want it to (am I making myself a little clear??)

       o The physical disk errors will not be mentioned
	 This  is a  rather strange bug 'coz at the Development Enviroment 
	 it works perfect! I'm working onnit. Just make sure you've got a
	 (formatted) disk in your drive and no errors will appear!

       o Pitch bending.
	 The replayer (still) does not a correct bend-down effect. This is
	 one of the oldest errors I know of, but still I haven't looked at
	 it! (who said I'm a lazy son-of-a-bitch ? Give'm a sigar!)




       I (shadow) would like to use this oppertunity to say something to:

       o Moonsoft	    Hey Remco! Eat this for breakfast (hahaha)
			    Thanx anyway for some stuff I did not use.
       o Wolf		    Hope you're sattisfied with this piece a work?
			    Thanx for waitin' and tips/hints for making
			    ORACLE one of the biggest!
       o New World Order    (what kinda name is that for some idiots who
			    attempt to beat my coding?) Keep up the good
			    work, I love your enthousiasm.
			    Thanx for tips!
       o Savage 	    A special thanx to you my friend! It's been a
			    long time since we've had some beer, let's get
			    together again some time!
