	  This text gives information about the effects used in ORACLE.

       There are 4 types of effects with different modes namely:
		 WWWWWWW			   WWWWW
       type:		modes:
       o Frequency	Normal, Arpeggio, Modulation and slide
       o Volume 	Normal, Modulation and slide
       o Brightness	Normal, Modulation and slide
       o Keying 	Normal and retrig

       Only ONE mode per effect_type can be used at one time!
       On  the	next  pages,  the  effects  will  be  explained  with some 
       examples.

				      Notes
				      WWWWW

       The following notes are possible in a NOTE channel:

		     C	C#  D  D#  E  F  F#  G	G#  A  A#  B


       When  ever a note is presented, the corresponding frequency will be 
       set, and a KEY_ON command will be executed.
       However, a  NOTE_LINK effect  at the secundairy collumn of the same 
       step will Not do a KEY_ON.


				    Note_Link
				    WWWWWWWWW

       This  effect will  only set  the corresponding  frequency of a NOTE 
       that's been given in the primairy collumn of a step.

       example:
			C_4  00 	Set note C4 frequency and TRIG it.
			___  00 				  (KEY_ON)
			___  00
			___  00
			G_4 lnk 	Set note G4 frequency (KEY
			___  00 			       remains on)

				   KEY_ON/OFF
				   WWWWWWWWWW

       A note will only be performed if the KEY of this note is set ON.
       (see Note/Note_link).
       When  ever  a  note  is	done,  it  can	be  killed with  the "OFF" 
       instruction at the primairy collumn (see also SUSTAIN)

       example: 	C_4  00 	Set note C4 frequency and TRIG it.
			___  00 				  (KEY_ON)
			OFF  00 	Kill note (KEY_OFF), no sustain.
			___  00
						

			      SUSTAINED KEY_ON/OFF
			      WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
			      
       When  ever   a  note   is  done,   it  can  be  killed with  either 
       the  instruction "OFF" or "SUS". When SUStain is used, the KEY will 
       be  set	OFF  and  the Sustain  of the  instrument will	handle the 
       fade_out of the note (also see KEY_ON/OFF)

       example: 	C_4  00 	Set note C4 frequency and TRIG it.
			___  00 				  (KEY_ON)
			SUS  00 	Kill note (KEY_OFF), with sustain.
			___  00 			     WWWWWWWWWWWW


				    VIBRATION
				    WWWWWWWWW

       This  is  a  FREQUENCY  MODULATION effect,  which is  given in  the 
       primairy collumn  and printed as "VIB".

       The  depth and  speed of  this modulation  is not (yet) adjustable. 
       It's a SINUS formed modulation.






				     TREMOLO
				     WWWWWWW

       This is a AMPLITUDE (read:volume) MODULATION effect, which is given 
       in the primairy collumn and printed as "TRM".

       The  depth and  speed of  this modulation  is not (yet) adjustable. 
       It's a SINUS formed modulation.






				     WAH_WAH
				     WWWWWWW

       This  is  a FILTER  (read: brighness)  MODULATION effect,  which is 
       given in the primairy collumn and printed as "WAH".

       The  depth and  speed of  this modulation  is not (yet) adjustable. 
       It's a SINUS formed modulation.






				    ARPEGGIO
				    WWWWWWWW

       This  effect  given in  the secundairy  collumn, will  act like	an 
       one_channel chord.
       It rapidly chanches the frequency of the channel without keying.
       The max. 2 additional (half)notes are based on the original note.

       example: 	C_4  47 	Plays the following 3 notes:
			___  00 	  C4 / E4 / G4	    ^
			C_4  44 	Plays the following 2 notes:
			___  00 	  C4 / E4	    ^


				     VOLUME
				     WWWWWW

       With  this  effect  it  is  possible  to alter  the Amplitude  of a 
       channel from #00 to #3F.

       Any Volume effect (see Tremolo) will be based on this value.
       A volume given at the primairy collumn, will always be the same for 
       this  channel untill  another volume  command is set. An instrument 
       change does not affect the current volume of a channel!




				   INSTRUMENT
				   WWWWWWWWWW

       Represents  the	voice/colour  of a  note.

       Various	instruments  are  available  in Oracle	(see: ORIGINAL-  / 
       STANDARD- /  STANDARD PLUS  instruments / SAMPLE and DRUMKIT at the 
       Index files)

       Instruments must be selected in the "Instrument List" before it can 
       be used.
       This function will NOT set a new volume! But the Brightness will be 
       updated from the instrument voice data.
 
				     TUNING
				     WWWWWW

       This command will adjust the Note_frequencies of a channel. 

       The  value is signed, so it can be either Positive or Negative with 
       a range from:
			 -#F  to  +/-#0  to  +#F.






				PITCH BEND	 
				WWWWWWWWWW

       Pitch_bending is another word for Frequency_sliding.
       Once a note is given, a pitch_bend can be added.

       The  value is signed, so it can be either Positive or Negative with 
       a range from:
			 -#F  to  +/-#0  to  +#F.





				  VOLUME SLIDE
				  WWWWWWWWWWWW

       With this effect it is possible to make a fast (de-)cresendo.

       The slide will be based on the current VOLUME (see Volume).
       

       The  value is signed, so it can be either Positive or Negative with 
       a range from:
			 -#F  to  +/-#0  to  +#F.



				BRIGHNTESS SLIDE
				WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

       With this effect it is possible to make a fast brightness slide.

       The   slide  will   be  based   on  the	 current  BRIGHTNESS  (see 
       FILTER/BRIGHTNESS).
       
       The  value is signed, so it can be either Positive or Negative with 
       a range from:
			 -#F  to  +/-#0  to  +#F.



				FILTER/BRIGHTNESS
				WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

       Controls  the sound/voice  of a FM_instrument. It regulates sertain 
       hi_frequencies which can sound very 'agresive'.

       Therefore  a FILTER  (read: Brightness, also known as the X-effect) 
       command is  needed to  make instruments	sound more  'softly'. Just 
       experiment with it, to understand it's perpose. The max. X-value is 
       set at #3F.

       This function will only work with Original instruments!
       An (org)instrument change updates the brightness of a channel.

				      TEMPO
				      WWWWW

       This function regulates the current Tempo of a replayed song. It is 
       Global, so all channels will respont on this.

       The max. value is set at #1F.







				    TRANSPOSE
				    WWWWWWWWW

       With this  command it  is possible to adjust all notes (global). It 
       will add/Sub the (half)notes to each note.

       It is a global function, so all channels will respont on it.
       The  value is signed, so it can be either Positive or Negative with 
       a range from:   -#F  to	+/-#0  to  +#F.

       example: 	C_4  00 	Play note C4
			___ q+3 	All following notes 3 half notes 
			C_4  00 	Play note D#4 (C4+3)	      up.

				     RETRIG
				     WWWWWW

       With this function a Note can be retriged (see: Note or KEY_ON/OFF)

       The  value  given at  the secondairy  collumn represents  the speed 
       (Vertical Blanks) between the Keying.
 
       The value is set at max. #F





				   TIMER BYTE
				   WWWWWWWWWW

       When  this  function  is  executed, the	application can  read it's 
       contents to respond on the playing song.

       For example  when a program needs to be timed on a sertain piece of 
       music, it can simply read the TIMER_BYTE.
       The value is set at max. #F

       example: 	___ y05 	Set Timer_Byte contents at 5
			___  00


				  PATTERN BREAK
				  WWWWWWWWWWWWW

       Will  cut the  current playing  pattern, and  goes on  to the  next 
       position/pattern.

       It is needed to play other timings than just straight 4/4.

       example: 	C_4  00 	Play the note C4
			___  00
			___  00
			___ ptb 	Cut the pattern after 4 rows.


				  RESET CHANNEL
				  WWWWWWWWWWWWW

       With this functin the original data (set at "Channel Routing") will 
       be set at the current channel.

       This comes in handy when a piece of music has to be restarted. Just 
       give  each channel the Reset command at the secundairy collumn, and 
       the Instrument/Volume  and Tuning  will be restored as given in the 
       Channel Routing.




				   KILL EFFECT
				   WWWWWWWWWWW

       The  Kill  command  will  cut  all Effects  playing at  the current 
       channel.

       example: 	C_4  48 	Play C4/E4/G4 (arpeggio)
			TRM r04 	Tremolo and Retig ON
			WAH  00 	Wah_Wah effect.
			___ kil 	Cut all previous effects.
