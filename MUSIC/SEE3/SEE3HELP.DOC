       Sound Effect Editor v3.00 A  (31/10/94)	    (c) FUZZY LOGIC 1991/94
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
	       
       SEE  v3.xx  is  NOT  a  100%  Public  Domain  program,  but  it's 
       SHAREWARE! This means that the program may never be sold for profit 
       other  than the	costs of  the disc/service.  You can use SEE v3.xx 
       just for zip and my copy it as much as necessary. However, when you 
       use SEE	3.xx for a commercial product, a amount of money has to be 
       paid  to the  coders (that's us). Contact us at the addresses given 
       at the end of this doc. For any update check your PD dealer.


				 INSTALLING SEE

       SEE v3.xx can be installed on every (MSX-DOS) disc and even on your 
       hard disc. It's NOT (yet) fully DOS 2.x compatible. You should copy 
       the folowing files to boot SEE:

       - SEE3	 .bin	The BASIC loader ( bload "SEE3.bin",r )
       - SEE3	 .com	The DOS1 loader (no EXIT in this version, sorry)
       - SEE3	 .lib	The program itselves.
       - SEE3	 .prf	The preference file (not realy necessary to copy)
       - SEE3	 .doc	This document.

       On the  master disc there's also a SEE3 replay source_file which is 
       originally written in WBass2, but we saved it as an ASCII file. The 
       name of this file:

       - SEE3PLAY.asc	The assembly source file (replayer)

       We've also made some example SFX for ya'll:

       - SEE3XAMP.see	The example SEE3 file.


				 UPDATE OUTLINES

       Why  a new  version of  SEE you	might ask.  Well to be short, SEE2 
       wasn't as  perfect as  we thought it was. This total new version is 
       much  different from  all the other versions we've released before. 
       Some advantages towards SEEv2.xx are:

       o  Much easier and there for faster to edit.
       o  More	than one  pattern on  your screen.
       o  Block commands, which make editing much quicker.
       o  New options that does a lotta work for ye.
       o  A total new  file_format, which  will be  reduced in length when 
	  saving it on disk.


			   THINX FOR THE FUTURE

       o  Fully DOS 2.xx compatible, so it can be installed on your HD.
       o  Together with DOS2, a directory select option.
       o  The cruncher in Diskmode (together with the decrunch source?).
       o  100% use of the mouse.
       o  Printer  options  (altought  it sounds  unnecessary, it  can be 
	  very usefull!).
       o  A possibility to run more than just 1 SFX at the same time!


				MAIN EDIT SCREEN

       In  this (main) screen, the SFX editor is stored. At the top of the 
       screen you'll  find some  options in  the main  menu, which  can be 
       selected with you cursors.
       At  the middle  of the screen, you can find the SFX patters. It can 
       display a  maximum of  13 patterns  at the  time. When moving up or 
       down,  the patterns  will scroll at the opposide direction. the 7nd 
       pattern which is lighted by a bar, is the current pattern to edit.
       At the  bottem of  the screen  you'll always  find the STATUS line. 
       Every action is displayed on this line.

				  PATTERN EDIT

       The  pattern  box  shows  13 patterns.  The one	you are  currently 
       editing on, is lighted up with a bar.
       One pattern contains 11 channels (Event and PSG data).

				    CHANNELS:

       - event (1)	In this extra channel you can set some extra FX. 
			For further details look at "Event channel".
       - snd# (2/3/4)	Same as PSG channels 0/1, 2/3 or 4/5. Here you can
			set the pattern sound frequency. When there's no
			data displayed, this channel is switched of auto-
			maticly (see "Sound channels").
       - rus# (5/6/7)	Same as PSG channel 6. This is the rustle channel 
			for  this   pattern.  There  is  only  one  rustle 
			register,  but	you  can  select  it for  each PSG 
			sound  channel (1,2  or 3).  When there's  no data 
			displayed the  rustle for  this channel  is turned 
			off (see "Rustle channels").
       - vol# (8/9/10)	Same as PSG channels 8/9/10. In these channels you 
			can  set the volume for PSG channels 1,2 or 3 (see 
			"Volume channels").
       - wave (11)	Same as  PSG channel 13. Here you can select the 
			Volume	envelope.  When it  contains no  data, the 
			volume wave  mode has not been used in one of the
			volume channels (see "Wave channel").
       - time  (12)	Same  as PSG  channels 11/12.  This contains  the 
			volume	envelope time.	If no volume wave has been 
			used,  this  channel displays  no data	(see "Wave 
			channel").


       Event channel

       In this channel can set some pattern effects like loops, speed etc. 
       The folowing commands are included:

	--	Empty. Does nothing.
       HALT (x) Wait for a little while before setting the CURRENT pattern
		data.
		In: x, total v_blanks (time in 1/50 or 1/60 sec.)
       FOR  (x) Set loop start pointer. A total of 4 loops can be mixed.
		In: x, total reloops.
       NEXT	Jump back to the pattern where you've set a FOR command if
		FOR (x)>0.
       START	Set rerun pointer.
       RERUN	Go to pattern where you've set START.
       TMP  (x) Set replay tempo.
       END	End of effect.

       To  edit these  events, just press the first letter of the command. 
       Like "E" for END, "R" for RERUN etc. Use Backspace to clear.


		example FOR/NEXT event:

			pat:	event:	psg data channels
			+-------+------------ -- -  -
			000	 FOR 7	... ... ...
			001	  -	... ... ...
			002	 NEXT	... ... ..
			003	 ...	... ... .

		Pattern 000+001 will be repeated 7 times.

       Sound channel (1,2,3)

       In this	channel you  can set  the sound frequency of each channel. 
       There  are  3  sound  channels  available.  In  SEE2  and  previous 
       versions,  you could  set both  the High  and Low  registers of the 
       frequency.  In  SEE3,  these  two registers  are combined  into one 
       register pare. It has a range from 000 to FFF.

       In these sound channels you can also set some extra effects. To set 
       these effects use SHIFT together with a key.
       The effects:
       D:xxx	Down slide (frequency Down)
       U:xxx	Up slide (frequency Up)
       (xxx = slide rate)

       Note:  Down slide means that the value will decrease, but the sound 
       you'll hear will go UP and vice versa! (only in frq channels).
 
       To switch the channel of, simply press on Backspace.


       Rustle channel (1,2,3)

       For every  sound channel  you can  set the rustle channel. However, 
       there's  only one  PSG rustle register so all channels will use the 
       same amount  of rustle.	But to use it in a channel you MUST define 
       it!.

       Like  the  sound  channels,  you  can slide  up and  down with  the 
       following effects:
       D:xx	Down slide
       U:xx	Up slide
       (xx = slide rate)

       Backspace to switch 1 channel off.


       Volume channel (1,2,3)

       Each  channel uses  it's own volume range which can be set in these 
       channels.

       Also in this channel you can find some extra effects:
       D:x	Down slide
       U:x	Up slide
       Wave	Volume development (PSG standard)
       (x = slide rate)

       The PSG	has 15	standard volume  waves (development). When you use 
       such  a wave,  set the  development pattern  & time  in the  last 2 
       channels (wave/time).

 
       Wave channel (pattern/time)

       In this	channel the volume development pattern can be set. It will 
       be  displayed only  when one  or more  volume channels  are using a 
       (standard) wave. Other wise it will be shitched of automatically.
 
       The development	time for  such a  pattern, can	be set in the last 
       channel. It's a combine of PSG regs 11 and 12 (000-FFF).

       Maybe   in  a   next  version   I'll  remove  the  standard  volume 
       development, 'cos no one is using it anyway (me neither).


				      BLOCK

       In this	version we  finally added some block functions. This block 
       is   very  usefull  for	quick  editing.  There's  only  one  block 
       available, the  start/end pats  will be	displayed at the main-menu 
       (Block:	xxx-xxx). When	a block  has been defined, the patterns in 
       this block will be lichted up with a colour bar.

       To  enter the  block commands  use the  [CODE] key. [CODE]+[S] will 
       set the start pattern while [CODE]+[E] will set the end pattern. To 
       remove this  block simply press [CODE]+space. For further functions 
       see Appendix A (keys).


				   PREFERENCES

       At  this screen,  you'll be able to edit some (screen)-settings the 
       way you	like'em best.  The preferences can be saved as "SEE3.prf". 
       When  this file is present while booting SEE, it will automatically 
       be included in SEE3.

 
				   DISK MODE

       In  this screen	you can save/load SFX files. Even a disk_format is 
       included here. The disk mode contains 2 different file types:

       - filename.SEE	All SFX saved in 1 file.
       - filename.SFX	Save/Load only 1 SFX.

       The .SEE fileformat will be detailed at Appendix B.
       When  loading  a .SFX  file, you've  gotta be  sure you've  set the 
       current SFX  start pattern.  If you  didn't, SEE  will prenounce  a 
       error-message.
       For saving  a .SFX  file, be  sure you set the start pattern and an 
       End-Of-SFX  command  (event:  "END" or  "RERUN")! SEE3  will always 
       check if you've set correct pattern data.

       When  using a  more than  1 drive, you can increase the Drive nr by 
       clicking on it.

       If you want to check your disk directory, press on DIR .SEE/SFX. If 
       you've done this before (and still using the same disk) then simply 
       press RETurn  on any .SEE or .SFX item. SEE3 will remember the last 
       DIRectory from both filetypes.

       We didn't  include the  cruncher yet, that's why this option is not 
       available.  In the  next update, it will be fixed. In the mean time 
       you could try to crunch it yerself.


       Well, what's  more to  say. If  you think  SEE3 could  be better or 
       you've  found  any  buggies,  please  contact  us  at the  folowing

       this momento.
