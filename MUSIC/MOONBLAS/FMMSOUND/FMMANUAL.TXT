Additional manual for MoonBlaster v1.03
=======================================

Although most MB v1.03 functions were already described in the old manual,
some small extra features are added. Here is a short description:

- An extra frequency table is added. Now there are three:

8363Hz (common Amiga freq)
22050Hz (common PC freq)
7875Hz (common Turbo-R freq)

Every higher octave will double the frequency. So if for example you want to
play a 44.1kHz you can use the 22050Hz table and play it one octave higher.

- You can use SELECT to change the end address and loop address quickly.
- The F4 key will defragment all sample RAM. This may be useful when the
  memory fragmentation says YES and you want to increase the largest free
  sample block.
- You can use the DEL key in the wave and tone edit menus to clear the wave
  or tone.
- It is possible to load big endian and little endian 16-bit samples


Other notes:

- Read the *.REV textfile for info about the program's revision history.
- MoonBlaster is NOT meant as a sample editor. Just edit your samples in a
  real sample editor until they are perfect, save them as RAW/PCM and then
  load the samples in MoonBlaster. A converter to convert from IFF, WAV and
  VOC files to RAW will be released later. This is not really neccessary
  since every good sample editor can save samples as RAW/PCM.
- When you load a raw sample 4 extra empty bytes will be added to the sample.
  This is done so that the OPL4 can loop on a silent sample part.
- Note that the USER and EDIT mode is also valid for Wavekits! When you save
  a wavekit in RAW mode, the EDIT mode will be used.
- The start address cannot be altered (yet?). The same goes for the sample
  type.
