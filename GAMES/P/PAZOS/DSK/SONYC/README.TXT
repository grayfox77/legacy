	1. Note for 7Mhz computers
----------------------------------
	SONYC is optimized for 7Mhz computers. If you run the game in 7Mhz mode
the music will play wrong. In this case, hold the [SELECT] key while booting thegame until the message "Loading R800 version" is displayed. This will make the  music sound properly.


	2. Note for MSX2+ users
-------------------------------
	If the scroll is not smooth while playing the game, try to deactivate
the sound effects or/and the game music in the options menu. Doing this the
scroll will be totally smooth. 

	3. About TV frecuencies
-------------------------------
	This game was developed for 50Hz, but if your TV or monitor only works
at 60Hz, you can change the frecuency by pressing the keys 5 or 6 in the main
menu. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to use it at 50Hz.

	4. About piracy
