THE X-LEVEL1 and X-LEVEL2 DIRECTORY

In the X-Level1 directory you will find the playable version of the crystal stage. Just run the
LOADER.COM program and the game will start. This level is not finished. The boss is missing and
the sprites get boring in the game. Many more sprites were planed but not finished or integrated.
Nevertheless, this is a playable level, which gives a quite good impression of the game.

In the X-Level2 directory you will find the playable version of the meteorite stage. This is just
different level data with the same sprites from the crystal level. So this level isn't playable 
properly, but also looks nice.

You can add and test your own graphics-levels with the same program. For a more detailed explanation
please see the README-file in the X-GFX folder.

I wish you a lot of fun test-playing the X-TAZY game.

Cheers
