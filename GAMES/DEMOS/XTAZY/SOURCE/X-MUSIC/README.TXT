THE X-MUSIC DIRECTORY

Here you will find music for the X-TAZY game, and probably even more. I personally collected all the little
music pieces and bits that I could gather and find for the game. The main two musicians for the project were:

1) Rodolphe Carrion alias Maverick (more classical, concert style music - like intro demo music and crystal stage)
2) Danilo Danisi alias DanDan (rather modern and techno style - like the music in level 2, meteorite and title music of game)

Please, if you use any of their music, be fair and mention their names. Thank you.

Cheers
