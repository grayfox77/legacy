THE X-CODE DIRECTORY

Here you will find all the code for the game. I am not sure if I got the latest version of the code, since I
used to only have backups of the project code. Hence, it might not be the latest version.

The main program (assembler) code was made by Martial Benoit.
The enemy routine (assembler) code was made by Franck Gerardin.
And the editors and intro code (C) was made by Michael Stellmann (Michi).

Unfortunately I do not have the code of the intro demo nor the editors (MSX or PC). If I will finally be
able to contact Michi and if he is willing to give me the source-codes, it will be handed over to MSX.ORG.
But I do not guarantee anything. 

In this directory you will also find a few test-programs, which are probably of no use at all. Nevertheless,
I have put it in there anyway.

Please, don't forget to mention the names of the coders if you use any of their sources. Thanks.

Cheers
