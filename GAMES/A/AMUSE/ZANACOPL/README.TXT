þþþ 2.0 What is Zanac Ex for MSX Audio?
 
	Zanac Ex  is a  great game developed  by Compile  and published by
Pony that runs on MSX2 or better computers. It was delivered in 1986, time
when was not common (if it was developed at all) a FM chip on MSX computer
and then the games is beautiful, but  features  only PSG music... Er, this
is the past.
	Egor (aka SOLID) had patched the game so it can use a  sound board
compatible with MSX Audio standard to play music. The result is great.
	But... What  Fudeba Software  has to  do  with  everything?  Well,
basically, the  game's version  the world  saw before  SOLID's site became
offline was basically infected by the virus ZAPP. Also, it was not able to
solve problems like  loading on MSX-DOS2 and  was coded  in a way it would
only load from the A: drive.
	After disassembly process, Fudeba Software find out that Solid had
used lots of  non-standard VDP accesses and  this was  corrected also. So,
this version is just a bug-fix on the loader, nothing more.
