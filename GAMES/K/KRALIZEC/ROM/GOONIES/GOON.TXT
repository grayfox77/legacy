The Goonies'r'good enough User's Manual

GOONIES 'R' GOOD ENOUGH!

Astoria, 1985.  Goon Docks are about to vanish because of a new country club
with a golf course.

Mikey can't allow this happens! He makes his mind up to go in search of One-Eyed
Willy's treasure: lots of rich stuff to pay the bills and avoid the end of the
neighbourhood. This can be his last goonie adventure, or maybe the greatest and
the first of many more.

Unhappily the Fratellis get involved and add a lot of troubles to the adventure.

Mikey needs some help from his friends, who he must find and free in first
place. He's sure that everything will be alright if he succeeds in joining the
complete band.

Help him to free the guys, run away from the Fratellis and find the treasure to
save Goon Docks.  Be careful: caverns under Astoria are full of nasty creatures
and dangerous pirate traps.

THE GANG

Mikey. He has the brains... and he has the key! Whenever you find a goonie,
you'll have to use the key to open the cage in order to free him/her.

Brand. Mikey's elder brother. Double courage, double strength. He always
protects Mikey, Andy and the guys.

Mouth. He never stops talking. His father's a plumber: maybe this can help in
the adventure. As strong as Mikey, not very corageous but he moves faster.

Data. The chinese teen Bond!. His gadgets can be very useful: a powerful
mechanic punch to frighten anyone (or anything) is the best one.

Stef. Andy's best friend. She's a girl as courageous and strong as any boy.
Someone you would want to be with you in a dangerous adventure.

Andy. A pretty cheerleader and maybe Brand's girlfriend. Not so courageous nor
strong, but she will play her role anyway.

Chunk. Chocolate lover. You may think he's kind of useless at first sight, but
give him sweets and he will manage anything.

COURAGE & TELEPHONE BOXES

You can control just one goonie at a time. That will be the gang leader for a
while.

Keep an eye on his/her "guts meter". The game ends when your courage reaches
zero.

It doesn't matter if other band members are courage-full. Just take care of the
current leader!  The goonie you're playing with has to be courageous enough to
face all that scary stuff.

So, if you think your leader is running out of nerve, run towards the nearest
TELEPHONE BOX and call another goonie. Let the frightened ones take a rest and
they'll recover sooner or later.  Be a smart player: change your goonie leader
as often as you need. They all have their role to play!

Remember:

1) avoid enemies and keep your nerve intact

2) if your courage decreases, look for a Telephone Box to call another goonie
less frightened than current leader

Whenever you come into a Telephone Box, you'll be able to choose another leader
between the freed goonies. Just stay into the box while the change sequence runs
and then come out of the box with your chosen new leader.

RELATIONSHIPS

Leader is important to know how fast the resting goonies are recovering their
guts-meter.

Take this ones in mind:

- while controlling Brand as the leader, Mikey will recover his courage very
  fast because of his elder brother's protection.

- Brand gets his nerve back so fast when Andy is the leader. That's the power of
  love!

- Mouth and Stef are always arguing, but they both recover much faster when
  the other is the leader. Their frienship is stronger than they think.

- if Andy feels gorgeous she will be a great (cheer)leader and not only Brand,
  but all the band will recover faster. Since there's a treasure down there,
  probably you can find some cute jewels to make her feel beautiful and
  confident.

KRALIZEC'S CUT

The game is divided into different "scenes".

In each scene you'll find a small sign stuck to the ground. Read it to learn
a special word which will allow you to continue on that scene.

That means you can play the complete game in one single shot, from the beginning
to the end...
...or you can play by scenes, thanks to saving passwords and Password Screen
(available from Title Screen, see "OLD TOC'S CORNER" section for further
information).

***

BONUS CONTENTS

Besides normal game and passwords, there're several secret keywords which
activate special game modes.

Here you are one of them (not secret anymore):

- JERKALERT: hard mode, for serious players. There's another hidden and harder
mode for hardcore players.

Find out the remaining ones to enjoy special game modes. Just read carefully
what the goonies say during the adventure.

TIPS

- Keep in mind that non-leader goonies will rest and recover their courage if
  you give them time enough.

- Brand is the stronger goonie. He's also very useful thanks to his MAP.  When
  you get lost look for a telephone booth and select Brand. Then push STOP key
  to pause the game and take a look at the map.

- Every goonie has a role to play. Use them all.

- There's a hidden screen in the map where you'll meet a very special gorgeous
  singer. It's worth looking for her!!

XTRA STUFF

If your MSX computer is equipped with a VDP9938 or higher you'll be able to
activate the following features by pressing these keys while loading the game:

<F1> Enjoy MSX game version though you use an MSX2 or higher machine.
<GRAPH> The real MSX1 palette will be emulated. This key works together with F1.
<SELECT> Disables default 60 Hz (NTSC) mode. From this point the game will run
at 50/60Hz depending on your MSX machine.
<HOME> To avoid VDP9958 and play MSX2-9938 version though you use an upper
machine.

Notes about DEMO GRAPHICS:

- some xtra screen12 images can be seen on MSX2+ and MSX TurboR. The same on
  MSX2 if it's equipped with a VDP9958.
- these demo graphics are not compulsory to enjoy the game itself, which is
  fully complete on MSX2-9938 and first generation MSX machines.

Notes about MUSIC:

- same sound speed at 50/60 Hz.
- the soft makes use of the special hard to get both external PSG and SCC.  So
  the volume balance is perfect on any MSX machine, since the PSG volume doesn't
  depend on the particular model.  Music will sound the same whenever you plug
  the cartridge.
