Introduction

Levels

The amazing classic puzzle game, Soukoban, is back, with a lot of
levels and improvements. Your goal is simple: move the boxes in order
to put them in the correct place. This concept is the base of this mindblowing puzzle game, created 21 years ago by Hiroyuki Imabayashi.
Now you can experience again the magic of this game in this revisited
version that KAROSHI CORP. brings to you. Can you clear all stages?.

The game has 65 different warehouses to play in the defaul POCKET
world.

How to Play

Soukoban World Editor

Move the character with cursor keys or joystick.

We are working to develop a World Editor so you can create new levels
for Soukoban Pocke Edition for MSX and load them with the LOAD WORD
option!. Stay tuned!.

If you are near a box and you move to its location you'll push it!.

If there is an obstacle or another box close to the box you want to push
and in the same direction you want to push it, you can't move that box!.

Place the boxes in the marked places to beat the level.

If you get blocked, press "ESC" to restart the level.

Press "SPACE" or joystick button if you want to undo the last move. This
will count as a step too!.

In this CD Edition you'll find a second track, containing an additional
world, called EXTEND world with 43 bonus stages. To play this world you
must select LOAD WORLD option from the main menu, and press play in
your CD player after selecting track 2.
