Introduction
Shoot to win with DUCK HUNT!. This fast-action target game takes you
into the marshes with your trusted hunting dog at your side. He'll flush
the ducks out from hiding but then, it's up to you to bring them down.
And if you take a partner with you the hunting will be more interesting,
becouse this game is up to 2 players!.
And if you want to join a 3rd player, he can also play as the ducks, moving
them with the cursor keys.

Controls
· For this game you need a light gun for MSX. The ones that works with
Duck Hunt for MSX are the GUNSTICK and the SEGA Light Paser. We'll
consider expanding the compatibility with other MSX lightguns if we
receive requests for doing it.
· The 3rd player can use the cursor keys to move the duck!.
