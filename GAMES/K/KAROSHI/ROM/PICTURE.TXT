Introduction
Test your power of deduction with this extremely addictive puzzle game
trying to find the hidden pictures. Your goal is to fill in the correct holes...
which hole are you suppose to fill in, you ask?. Well to figure out which
hole you are suppose to fill in, you have to look at the numbers to the left
and then on the top. Looks easy, but this game will trap you hours and
hours trying to figure out the solution.

Next, let's take a look at the 10th column from the
left. Here we find the number "4". In this column, 4
continuous squares in a row have been blacked out,
which means that the white space between the 2-1
can also be blacked out!. The other squares in this
column cannot be blacked out.

How to Play
This is how the game works!. You must fill the correct blocks in each stage
to find the picutre. For this, you must look at the numbers in the left and
in the right, becouse they mark extacly the number of painted blocks in
a row and in a column: note that the numbers tells you how many blocks
are painted but not the exact position, so you must mach both top and
left numbers to discover the painted blocks.

Let's return one more time to the numbers in the
horizontal direction. Both ends of the 8th row from
the top are already marked with an X, so we can black
out the remaining two boxes.

Here is an example!. Pay close attention!.

Next, when we look at the 6th row from the top, we
see the numbers "1-1-1-1-1". Following the rule that
there must be at least one empty block between
numbers, the minimum possible number of white
squares is 4. This number plus the total of the
numbers, which is 5, equals 9. This number is exactly
equal to the number of empty squares. Becouse the
square on the right end is blacked out, we black out
every other square starting from that point. Use this
method to black out the squares one by one.

Let's start with a big number, which will offer plenty
of valuable hints.
As you can see, the 5th, 7th and 8th rows from the
top are all blacked out!.

Completed. It's "CHINESE NOODLES", isn't it?

Next, look for the squares which can be definitely
blacked out.
The 9th row form the top is 8, so count 8 squares
from the left. In the same way, count 8 squares from
the right side. The overlapping area will be blacked
out no matter wich direction you start.

We didn't find any squares you can black out in the
horizontal direction, so let's move on to the vertical
direction. The first column from the left shows "21" starting from bottom, but these are already
blacked out. Thet means that none of the other
boxes in this column can be blacked out.
