ROM Xtractor v1.01 (c) by JAMSoft 1998
======================================

Program description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'ROM Xtractor' is a program for creating .ROM files from original MSX
cartridges. ROM files can be loaded with Trunks' LOADROM or any MSX emulator
such as FMSX, BrMSX and so.

System requeriments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'ROM Xtractor v1.01' needs a MSX machine with at least 64KBytes of RAM
Also is required a disk drive. Working under MSX-DOS2 hasn't been tested yet.


Installing and using ROM Xtractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'ROM Xtractor' is an easy-installation program: you only have to copy ROM-X.BIN
file to directory or drive you desire.

To run ROM Xtractor, type (from BASIC interpreter):

               BLOAD "ROM-X.BIN", R

Is recommended to boot with MSX-DOS before getting into the BASIC interpreter.

Program menus are very easy to use. There are two main menus. First has these
options:

          *     1-Choose Slot

                Use this option to select in which slot is inserted
                the cartridge you want to copy. If you don't know the slot
                numbers of your machine, use next option:

          *     2-Find cartridge

                You can use this option in order to find in which slot is
                the cartridge inserted. ROM Xtractor will show cartridges
                found in each SLOT and starting page of ROM (see next option).


          *     3-Select page (not MROM)

                ROMs use to start at page 1 (at #4000 address), but some
                cartridges start at page 0 (#0000 address) or page 2 (at
                #8000 address, except for 32K roms).

                This is applied for non-MegaROM (8,16,32 KB) cartridges only.
                Sometimes, when using option 2, MegaROMs seem to start at
                more than one page at the same time. This is caused because
                mapper is non-initialized. Ignore this, since MegaROMs always
                start at #4000.

          *     4-Continue

                Access to the second main menu.


          *     5-Quit

                Returns to BASIC.


The other main menu has these options:

          *     1-Mapper Analysis (MegaROM)

                This option is needed in order to know the kind of mapper
                that the cartridge uses. This program use soft-based detec-
                tion, so there is no 100% reliable way to analyze ROM data
                for getting the mapper. Estimated reliability is near 98%

                Only MegaROMs (>=128KB rom) need mapper analysis.


           *    2-Choose Mapper

                Since Mapper Analysis is not 100% reliable, manual selection
                of mapper may be required in order to find the right mapper
                of the MegaROM.
                
           *    3-Create ROM file

                Creates ROM file on disk. Before this, you will have to choose
                ROM size and a name (w/o extension) for saving the file.

           *    4-Back

                Returns to first main menu.


Important notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to make ROM dumps to disk, is necessary to insert the cartridge
with power switched on. This always has a risk of damage both your MSX machine
and your cartridge.

NOTE:
The author is not liable for any damage derived from right or wrong use
of 'ROM Xtractor'. The user will accept this in order to use 'ROM Xtractor'.

TIP: If you have a pause button on your MSX, press it in order to minimize
risk when inserting the cartridge.


About LOADROM program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LOADROM is a good, great, fantastic program created by Trunks. It has
capabilities for loading any ROM file (8, 16, 32 KB and MegaROMs) in any
MSX2 (or upper) machine.


LOADROM is freeware, so you can get it on the Internet. Please, visit
Trunks' Home Page:

                 http://capsule.home.ml.org/

Trunks is also working on a TCP/IP driver and multi-tasking enviroinment for
MSX. Check it!

I'm a MSXturboR user and I live in Granada (Spain). I bought my first MSX, a
Sony HitBit-75P in 1985. Six years after, in 1991, I bought a MSXturboR, and
I love it :)

This is my first program, I am not programmer, but musician. I composed the
music of Pentaro Odyssey and now I'm working on Pentaro Odyssey II.
