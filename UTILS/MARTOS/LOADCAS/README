LOADCAS
-------

This program acts as a general CAS file loader, and can be used on any MSX2
with 128K memory mapper. Basically, it copies the bios to ram and patches it,
redirecting the tape reading routines. This method allows any CAS file on disk
to be handled by the system as a real tape.

The program takes the form of a generic loader, which must be copied to the
same disk or directory where the CAS file is, renaming to match its filename.
For example, if you have ZARTH.CAS, do COPY"LOADCAS"TO"ZARTH.BIN" or simply
TO"ZARTH" (extension doesn't count). Then execute with BLOAD"ZARTH",R. The
program will set the system up and start loading with the proper command.

Improvements in version 2.0:
  - Load speed is quite fast. Not as much as in a tailored disk version, but
    just a matter of seconds.
  - Emulated tape automatically rewinds and restarts when finished.
  - Standard routines for slot access are also redirected, protecting the copy
    of bios in ram from being overwritten. But many programs use low-level port
    access when handling slots, so emulation can fail with them.
  - On MSX turbo R, the program takes advantage of DRAM mode for patching bios
    in slot 0-0 itself, avoiding completely the former problem. Basic is also
    patched, of course, restoring supressed commands like CLOAD or BLOAD"CAS:".

Improvements in this version 2.99 beta:
  - The package now includes an alternative loader called LOADCASX. This one
    explores the contents of ram after loading, and patches the program's
    possible accesses to slot-related ports. Since this technique is far from
    perfect, its use is recommended ONLY when standard LOADCAS fails.
  - LOADCASX is also useful on turbo R: it doesn't patch primary slot
    switchings (using DRAM mode, that's not necessary) but does patch secondary
    ones. This way, certain programs that mishandle expanded slot 0 are got
    working.
  - On MSX2+ from Panasonic and MSX turbo R, extra speed of these computers is
    turned on during CAS load.

Things to improve in future versions:
  - Changing CAS file.
  - Support for recording.
  - Support for file paths. By now, the CAS file must be located in the
    default drive or directory.
  - Loader in COM format.
