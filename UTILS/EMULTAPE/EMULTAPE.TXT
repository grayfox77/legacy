                         Emulate Tape for MSX-turboR

The MSX-turboR lacks one thing to the MSX-standard, the cassette-port.
However, there are games that require a tape-device to save game states on,
such as Metal Gear from Konami.

With this emulation program I hope to have extended the need of a tape-system
for the MSX-turboR just enough. The tape-emulator has been written in a
modular way, so it will be possible to enable other media to store this tape
data on. At the moment the MSX-turboR S-RAM (32 kB sized) is used to store
the tape data in.



Starting the emulator

The tape-emulator is started simply by executing BLOAD "EMULTAPE.BIN",R in
Basic. After loading it searches for the last stored file on media which
might take some time. This search can be disabled when starting the emulator
with the "NO"-key (left of the space-bar) on the MSX-turboR. This also means
all previously saved data for tape will be overwritten. When the last stored
file connot be found, it will go to the beginning automatically.


Using the emulator

Actually, the game should use the tape-emulator. There are some keys which
will simulate a rewind (to the start of the media) for loading and saving:

"YES"-key       rewinds tape for loading.
"NO"- and "YES"-key simultaneously rewinds tape for saving.


Ideas for future releases

- Adjust for MSX-2 and MSX-2+ as well as MSX-turboR
- Create modules for more media (maybe even multiple media)


If you have any ideas yourself (such as media which can be used), please mail
them to me on bifi@msxnet.org (preferably with documentation about how to use
this media).
