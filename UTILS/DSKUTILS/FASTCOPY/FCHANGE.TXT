Fastcopy patch for Turbo R with harddisk. 
 
By Henrik Gilvad. 
 
 
Fastcopy  by Xelasoft  is a  exellent piece of software but  
there is  a litle  thing that  I want  to change  in it. It  
reads  which slot  the Floppy disk controller is located in  
by peeking at (#FB22). This is ok when there is no harddisk  
connected but  if there  is then  the harddisk slot will be  
the result of the peeking. 
 
To  change this  I have  made a  small basic  program which  
loads, change  and saves  the "FASTC30.L03" file so that it  
will  do a  "LD A,#8B NOP" instead of a "LD A,(#FB22)". The  
#8B is      the Slot-Id  for the  FDC in  the Turbo  R A1ST and
 A1GT. If you have to change this Slot-Id number then it can  
be done in the basic program. 
 
Fastcopy will not use the harddisk but now it is posible to  
run it from harddisk or with a harddisk connected. You dont  
have  to  restart  your Turbo  R when  you want  to make  a  
diskcopy. 
 
The  basic  program  is named  "FCHANGE.BAS" and  should be  
somewhere on this disk.
