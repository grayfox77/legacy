CMPDSK
------

Format:      CMPDSK [d: [d:] [/A] [/B] [/S] [/P]]

Purpose:     Compares two  disks and  displays all unmatching sectors
	and/or bytes.

Use:	     If  no drives  are given, then the current drive will be
	compared with itself.

	     If only  one drive is given, then the current drive will
	be compared with the given drive.

	     If  no options  are given, then all sectors will be com-
	pared until  an unmatching sector is found. Then a message is
	printed.

	     When using the /S option, the sector number of the first
	sector that  doesn't match,  is printed. The /A option can be
	used  to compare  all sectors.	The /B	option will  not only
	print the  sector number, but also the number of the unmatch-
	ing bytes, within the sector, is printed.

	     If the /P option is given, then the output will pause at
	the bottom of the screen until a key is pressed.

	     Note that CMPDSK is a transient command, and must there-
	fore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

	CMPDSK B:

	     The disk  in drive  b: is	compared with the disk in the
	current  drive. If  a sector  on drive b: is found, that does
	not match with the same sector on the current drive, then the
	message 'disks don't match' is printed.

	CMPDSK A: C: /S

	     The  disk in drive a: is compared with the disk in drive
	c:. If	a sector  on drive  a: is  found, that does not match
	with  the same	sector on  drive c:,  then the number of that
	sector is printed.

	CMPDSK A: B: /B/A/P

	     The disk  in drive a: is compared with the disk in drive
	b:.  If a  sector on  drive a:	is found, that does not match
	with the  same sector  on drive  b:, then  the number of that
	sector	is printed,  along with  the number of the bytes that
	differ. The  comparison will  continue with  the next  sector
	until  all sectors are compared. At the bottom of the screen,
	the output will be paused until a key is pressed.
