SETAT
-----

Format:      SETAT [filespec [options]]

Purpose:     Changes the attributes of files.

Use:         The option available are:

              [/A[+|-]] [/H[+|-]] [/R[+|-]] [/S[+|-]] [/N] [/P]

             The filespec specifies the files whose attributes are to 
        be changed.

             If /A  is given, then the selected files will have their 
        'archive'   attribute  changed   (i.e.  when   the  'archive' 
        attribute was  set, it  will be reset, and when it was reset, 
        it will be set).

             If /H  is given, then the selected files will have their 
        'hidden' attribute changed.

             If /R  is given, then the selected files will have their 
        'read only' attribute changed.

             If /S  is given, then the selected files will have their 
        'system file' attribute changed.

             When  the above mentioned options are followed by a '+', 
        the specified  attribute will  be set. When they are followed 
        by a '-' the specified attribute will be reset.

             If  none of  the above mentioned options are given, then 
        the current  attributes of the selected files are printed. If 
        many  files are  printed, then  the /P  option can be used to 
        cause the output to pause at the end of the screen.

             When  an error occurs, the erroneous filename is printed 
        followed by  an error  message, and the command will continue 
        with  the next file. If many errors occur, then the /P option 
        can be  used to  cause the  output to pause at the end of the 
        screen.

             When no  /N option  was given, then all filenames, along 
        with their new attributes, are printed.

             Note  that SETAT is a transient command, and must there- 
        fore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

        SETAT FILE1

             The attributes of file FILE1 are printed.

        SETAT B:\DIR1\*.COM /H

             All *.COM  files in  the directory  B:DIR1 are marked as 
        hidden, if they were not hidden, or are marked as not hidden, 
        if they were hidden.

        SETAT \DIR1 /H

             The  directory DIR1  in the root directory will have its 
        'hidden' attribute changed.

        SETAT \DIR1\ /R+/N

             All  files in  the directory DIR1 will be marked as read 
        only. There will be no output on the screen, except for error 
        messages.
