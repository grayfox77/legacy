 After using the COMPLETE command, you can get Total by using COMPUTE command.

        T/Maker calculated  Total  but  there  are unnecessary
        numbers, Total of  QUA and  PRIC.  How to delete these
        numbers has already been explained.  Try for yourself!

         "..<HERE>  is neglected  because "."  mark of  the first
         column is design command.

         File "MASTER" must have the following structure.
