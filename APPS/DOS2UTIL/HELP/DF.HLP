Format:      DF [ /A ] [ drive... ] [ filename... ]


Purpose:     Reports free disk space


Use:         DF  displays  the  capacity of  the  currently  mounted 
        disks, the amount of used and available space, and how  much 
        of  the  disk's total capacity has been used.  Used  without 
        arguments,  DF  reports  on all  mounted  drives,  producing 
        something like:

          C:\TUTORIAL> DF
          Volume      Kbytes  used avail capacity  Mounted on
          RAM-DISK      129     89    39   70%       A: [H:]
          SYSTEM      22277  20700  1558   93%       B: [A:]




             Note  that used+avail is less than the amount of  space 
        in  the  file system (Kbytes); this is  because  the  system 
        reserves  a  fraction of the space in the  file  system  for 
        housekeeping. 

             If arguments to DF are disk drives (for example, A:) or 
        path  names,  DF  produces  a  report  on  the  file  system 
        containing  the named file. Thus "DF ." shows the amount  of 
        space on the file system containing the current directory.

        Options:

        /A   Reports  on all filesystems including drives  that  are 
             off-line.
