Format:      RUNDISK drive [options]


Purpose:     Runs application or game software from a bootable  disk 
        in a drive other than A:.


Use:         Disk software depending on the startup code in the boot 
        sector  can normally only be run from the first  disk  drive 
        attached  to the lowest-numbered slot, i.e.  physical  drive 
        A:.  If  this  drive is not compatible with  the  disk,  for 
        example because it is a 5.25" drive or a hard disk, it  must 
        be  removed from the system so that the other drive  becomes 
        drive A:.






             In  this case RUNDISK may be used to load  and  execute 
        the  boot  sector from a different drive. RUNDISK  tries  to 
        make  the  system  believe  that  drive  was  drive  A:   by 
        intercepting  MSXDOS calls _RDABS and _WRABS and the  PHYDIO 
        hook and reASSIGNing the drive names, then loads sector 0 at 
        the standard address &HC000 and executes the boot code.

             There is no guarantee that this procedure works for all 
        programs since there are so many different non-standard ways 
        to  perform disk I/O (like directly calling the DSKIO  entry 
        of  the  disk  driver  ROM,  in  which  case  it  cannot  be 
        intercepted at all).

             For the hard cases there are some command line  options 
        that  should only be given if the application disk does  not 
        run correctly otherwise:

        /S:    Add  code to stop the disk drive after  each  access. 
        This  is  for programs that overwrite H.TIMI  and  therefore 
        disable  the countdown timer that normally stops  the  drive 
        motor. Using /S probably slows down disk I/O dramatically.


        /F:    Provide  a DOS 1 style FAT buffer for  the  simulated 
        drive A:. This fixes an incompatibility between MSXDOS 1 and 
        MSXDOS  2, so this option may help programs that cannot  run 
        under MSXDOS 2 at all otherwise.

        /1 or /2: Treat the disk as single or double sided 80  track 
        disk,  regardless of the ID byte. This option is  for  disks 
        that  would  normally be rejected with a "Not  a  DOS  disk" 
        error  message.  The  internal operation of  MSX-DOS  2  may 
        require  that a normal single or double sided disk has  been 
        accessed in that drive before.


        Programs  that  perform  a  reset as  a  part  of  the  boot 
        procedure  (e.g.  Synth  Saurus)  cannot  be  started   with 
        RUNDISK.







Examples:

        Some  programs  that  can be started  without  command  line 
        options (RUNDISK D:):

             Undeadline, Aleste 2, Disc Station

        Some programs that may need the /S option (RUNDISK D:/S):

             Golvellious, Gandhara, Super Cooks

        One program that needs the /F option (RUNDISK D:/F):

             Might & Magic 2

        One program that needs the /2 option (RUNDISK D:/2):

             Laydock 2
