Sound Cartridge ROM loader
--------------------------

Using this utility you can load ROM files into the Sound 
Cartridge. This will always work for ROM files not larger 
than 32Kb. You must have expanded the memory to load
megaROMs.

Usage:

SCROM [-<options>] <filename>

<filename> is the ROM file you wish to load into the 
Sound Cartridge. 

<options> are the options for loading the file, unix 
style. Possible options:
  r  Soft resets the MSX after loading the ROM file
  s  Starts the ROM file after loading it
  c  Loads konami4 type ROM file (converts to konami5)

If you, for example, want to load Nemesis (which is a 
konami4 type and want to start it directly, type:

  SCROM -SC NEMESIS.ROM

Note that, like MSX DOS, it is not case sensitive. 
The order of the options does not matter.

Some ROM files, like Konami Synthesizer, require a reset
to execute. To load and start Synthesizer:

  SCROM -R SYNTHE.ROM

If you execute SCROM without the R or S option, the ROM 
file will be loaded into your Sound Cartridge, but not 
executed or whatever. You'll just return to the prompt.

Only if you have expanded the RAM of your Sound Cartridge 
to 128Kb, you can also load Konami megaROMs into your 
Sound Cartridge. This will only work for the 1 megabit 
megaROMs.

If you're using the standard (SD) Snatcher Sound Cartridge 
(only 64Kb), the RAM will be deselected after a hard 
reset.
