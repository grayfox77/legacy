     TERM4MSX v1.0b --- A VT100 terminal for MSX RS232 interfaces
     ============================================================
                        (c) 2000  Grauw / TNI


Hi there.

This textfile belongs to the TERM4MSX distribution, and in it is an 
explanation of how to use the program, my motivation, a ToDo list, a 
release-list and some about-information.

Along with the archive come the following files:
TERM4MSX.COM --- The terminal program itself
TERM4MSX.TXT --- This textfile
DRIVER.COM --- The Erix Fossil-driver


How does it work
================

First of all, you need Dos2 and an Erix Fossil-compatible RS232 interface 
before you can use TERM4MSX. First load the Fossil-drivers and then start 
TERM4MSX.COM. You will get to the intro-screen, where you can choose to dial 
one of the two predefined numbers (F1-F2), or any other number. After that, 
when you want to download a file, press F3 to initiate the transfer in 
Ymodem-G mode. You can at any time quit the program by pressing F5.

Key map:
F1 - Dial predefined BBS #1
F2 - Dial predefined BBS #2
F3 - Initiate downloading (Ymodem-G only)
F5 - Quit TERM4MSX

The program is still far from complete (see ToDo), it's still in beta stage, 
but I decided not to let you wait any longer. It still lacks a lot of 
features, some of them are even already implemented but just not accessible 
because there is no UI, like the logfile and smooth scrolling. Also, only 
Ymodem-G downloading is possible so far.


Motivation
==========

Why did I write this terminal program? Aren't there enough of them??? No. The 
Sunrise-RS232 hasn't got a BIOS. Therefor, it can only be used by programs 
especially written for it or by use of a driver, for example the Erix 
Fossil-driver, which is very fast and compatible. So far, only Erix supports 
the Sunrise RS232, and colors are only available in the Gfx9000 version.

Therefor, I decided to write a terminal-program using the Fossil-drivers which 
would support fast color-ANSI support on the 'old' v9938. And before you is 
the result, I have tried to make it as fast as possible, I have however not 
had the time to work on the user-interface yet.

And yes, I know the name (TERM4MSX) is not very inspirational. If you have 
suggestions for another name, let me know.

If you feel like supporting me with my work, please donate a small amount of 
money to my bank account or send it to my address. Thank you!


ToDo
====

This version still lacks a lot of stuff:
- Any kind of user interface
- Any settings like baudrate, parity, whatever
- Several other quite nessecary functions like a BBS List
- User-friendlyness

Transfer:
- No Xmodem and Zmodem support, only Ymodem-G support.
- Support for 1024-byte headers
- Retransmission support
- CRC check is still missing
- No uploading
