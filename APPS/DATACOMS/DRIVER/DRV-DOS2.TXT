Are you tired of using the fossil driver and having to type CALL SYSTEM after it? Did you ever want to load a command after it too? 
Now the solution is here!!!

Roberto Vargas patched this driver (download it here!) in such a way that it does not go to basic anymore. DOS2 will be always present, then. Furthermore, if you execute it together with another program, it will be executed after installing the driver:

Example:

DRIVER DIR /P

Then the driver will be installed, and after it, a DIR /P will be executed.
