ObsoNET is an Ethernet card for MSX computers, formerly designed and
manufactured by Daniel Berdugo. In this section you will find the software
that I have developed for this card.

Important: Please upgrade your ObsoNET card BIOS to version 1.2, which
is compatible with the Ethernet UNAPI, so you can use the newest version
of InterNestor Lite. The old InterNestor Lite for ObsoNET (version 1.0x)
is now discontinued.

ONETM-S.TXT: ObsoNET user's and programmer's manual. Spanish version.
ONETM-E.TXT: ObsoNET user's and programmer's manual. English version.
ONETFRL.COM: ObsoNET Flash ROM loader 1.0. This application is necessary
in order to update the ObsoNET BIOS and burn custom programs on its ROM.

BIOS.ROM, BIOSDOS2.ROM, BIOS.DAT: ObsoNET BIOS 1.2. This version is
compatible with BIOS 1.0, but adds compatibility with the Ethernet
UNAPI. On the user's manual the differences between the three files
are explained.

BIOS10.LZH:The old BIOS version 1.0, in case you experience problems
with BIOS 1.2 (you should not, of course!)

InterNestor Lite. With BIOS 1.2, you can use InterNestor Lite for the
Ethernet UNAPI with your ObsoNET card.

As a starting point for working with ObsoNET, it is recommended to read
sections 1 and 2 of ObsoNET manual, as well as section 2.3 of InterNestor
Lite manual.
